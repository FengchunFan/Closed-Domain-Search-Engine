(...) Today, all sorts of mobile devices, including smartphones, tablet PCs, smartwatches, digital cameras, wearable fitness trackers, game controllers, and virtual reality headsets, have built-in accelerometers. (...) Accelerometers are the most widely used sensor in wearable devices and also the sensor that is most frequently accessed by mobile apps (...) In contrast to sensors like microphones, cameras and GPS, mobile apps can access accelerometer data without requiring user permission. (...) We found that accelerometer data alone may be sufficient to obtain information about a device holder\u2019s location, activities, health condition, body features, gender, age, personality traits, and emotional state. Acceleration signals can even be used to uniquely identify a person based on biometric movement patterns and to reconstruct sequences of text entered into a device, including passwords.\"",

Just as entering credit card information onto a website was inconceivable in the early days of the internet, it may be difficult to conceive a system that maintains all of our data in a private wallet.However, before the cloud, we used to keep everything on our own computers. We couldn't have imagined employing cloud technology for even a quarter of the things that are now standard.  \nThe Cloud is not decentralized data. The Cloud is a proxy for centralized services managed by major organizations located far away, which you must rely on. The decentralized web is similar to BitTorrent or Napster. It is not operated by a single service, and you do not need to rely on a single party.\n\nAlthough cloud computing has certain scalability benefits, decentralization is far more resilient. There isn't a single point of attack. Data saved on a Cloud service can be removed at any moment if any terms are violated. When you own your own data on the Decentralized Web, no one can take it away from you, neither the government nor anybody else. This is becoming an increasingly critical issue in many countries.\n\nAlmost every service we use saves our data and then costs us a price to get it. Many free applications do not feature an offline option, forcing users to share their data at all times, even if they would like to keep it private.\n\nAt some time, it will be cheaper and safer for each of us to function as our own personal servers, especially when it comes to our medical information, which is the most personal of all.",

Is it appropriate to temporarily store a password in primary storage using an operating systems security APIs? Yes, it is appropriate. Is it appropriate to temporarily store a password on secondary storage? Never. Everything else has to deal with data routes and their targets, some leaving information behind even after deletion which can be recovered. The goal is to select the appropriate storage device, and path, which provides the least amount of success for recovery and tampering but also remain performant depending on the sensitivity level of the information. It's to get developers to think like engineers by questioning the system and visualizing how their data moves throughout it, and if such a move leaves any evidence behind both directly and indirectly (such as the possibility of data being paged to disk).",

So far it sounds like the exams are expected to be released around mid Dec 2021.\n\nThere will 2 courses and 2 exams which are AZ-800 and AZ-801.\n\nI'm delivering free training on the Microsoft AZ-800 at the moment for those that's interested. If you go check the exam objects and skills measured for the AZ-800 on the official Microsoft website you will notice that there is basically nothing new in this course (If your not new in Server). They simply took things from various existing courses like the 20740 and AZ-900 and mashed them together and called it a new course and exam lol.\n\nWith that being said, this course and exam is also intended for people brand new to IT and Server so the first part of the course is obviously going to cover the basics of Windows Server 2019 and Azure and then it will gradually work it's way up to the more complicated stuff.\n\nI already have a few videos up and I will be making more and uploading them as time allows me to so feel free to have a look from time to time to see if one of them covers something you don't know yet.\n\nHere is a link to the 2min course intro explaining the course for those that's interested in this:\n\n[**Microsoft AZ-800 Course Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkWLn06OiXY&list=PLc6LqxQFwub8sskcc3_UqaDtnw-Qp-yPD)",

Avira PWM (PassWord Manager) has built-in access to using the haveibeenpwned API for their Pro edition, that lets you do a security audit (must be manually initiated) of your stored email addresses and passwords to detect if any have been compromised. \n\nThis is very useful for finding out if your favorite password or your email account had been detected in data breaches, and you'll see a list of which breaches it matches. if you find a match for your email address and haven't changed your password since that breach, you should change it immediately. Also, if you use any passwords that match as detected, you should stop using those and change it immediately.\n\nKeeping your accounts secure is still one of the most vulnerable fundamentals. too many people still use insecure passwords, passwords that have been compromised, or the same password for every login. Use a password manager (I personally like Avira PWM, but there are a handful of other legit ones such as Keeppass, LastPass, and others) or stuff something notable about the site into your password to make it unique to each site, at the least. such as, if your base password used for every site is P4ssW0rd$ then you could use P4ssW0rd$tw1t for Twitter, P4ssW0rd$g00g for Google, etc... it's not as secure as using completely random passwords via a password manager, but if your hashed password is stolen along with your email address during a breach, your other accounts can't be hacked by simple credential stuffing, since each unique password, no matter how slight the difference, has an entirely different hash. \n\nHope this info helps some.",

I was a systems admin for my entire career focusing first on mini systems and then moving rapidly into Unix admin work on Sun systems, then into the Linux server world. I was never much of a Windows systems admin but I knew enough to be dangerous and was a power user to be sure. The point of this is that as a systems admin if you\u2019re not thinking about securing OS, network, and data you\u2019re not a good systems admin. If you\u2019re working the policy and compliance side of Infosec then you have to know something about how systems and networks work, but if you\u2019re working in the trenches of systems and network security then to be good you have to be **very** knowledgeable about how systems and networks work.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Infosec engineer does that mean that you have to know multiple programming or systems scripting languages? Not really, although Powershell, Python, Linux/Unix shell scripting is very useful. Do you have to in principle know that a sysadmin well versed in those tools can do X and Y? Yes, and that\u2019s what you did when you asked the dweeb to run something for you. To do systems Infosec well you have to know what to ask for and why, and the newb didn\u2019t have a clue about the what or why, and so no knowledge of the how. \n\nOn the team that I was part of before I retired, I and one other senior security guy often ended up diagnosing what failed when our company (a hospital) had some kind of a major network meltdown because we were better at it than the network guys. That\u2019s because the network guys really only focused on the router and switching protocols which they rather arrogantly felt was deep tribal magic which only they understood. My colleague in Infosec engineering and I focused on the whole network stack at the client/server level in addition to understanding routing. We understood network tracing and packet analysis tools, and our network admin colleagues didn\u2019t really work at that level much at all. If you\u2019re an Infosec analyst or engineer working on the infrastructure side of things you need to develop deep knowledge of how systems and networks work under the covers. As long ago former Sun Microsystems leader Scott McNeely said, \u201cThe network is the computer,\u201d and you\u2019d better understand that deeply and well. \n\nSo, knowing intelligently what to ask for and what to look at is more valuable and broader in nature than just looking at the micro world of just one OS. It\u2019s an unfortunate fact that particularly in the world of Microsoft administration there\u2019s an awful lot of OS admin skill which is taught without also teaching the underlying OS and network principles behind them. The Newb is an example of that.",

An attacker could exploit the flaw and gain access to Active Directory domain controllers with administrative privileges.\n\nMicrosoft released a patch to correct the flaw on August 2020 Patch Tuesday; however, many organizations have yet to apply the patch and are vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe Iranian nation-state advanced persistent threat group Mercury APT has been exploiting the flaw over the past two weeks. Mercury APT \u2013 aka MuddyWater/SeedWorm/Static Kitten \u2013 typically targets government organizations for espionage purposes.\n\nAn unnamed adversary was discovered to be using an exploit for a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to remotely attack unpatched servers, then implants a web shell for persistent access and code execution, then deploys Cobalt Strike and explores the network perimeter and targets domain controllers using the Zerologon exploit.\n\nThe TA505 threat group is also using a Zerologon exploit. A campaign is being run that uses fake software updates to make a connection to their command and control infrastructure. They then elevate privileges on the target system and run malicious scripts using Windows Script Host (WScript.Exe). The attackers compile a version of the Mimikatz post-exploit tool using MSBuild.exe, which incorporate exploit code for the Zerologon vulnerability, allowing them to takeover domain controllers.\n\nThe Zerologon vulnerability received the maximum CVSS score of 10 out of 10 and several warnings have been issued to apply the patch promptly to prevent exploitation. Multiple threat groups are now actively exploiting the flaw with further groups also likely to start using the exploit, so it is now essential that the patch is applied.",

Hopefully this helps!\n\n**\ud83d\udd13 Cyber Attacks**\n\n**Cybercrooks Scrape OpenAI API Keys to Pirate GPT-4**\n\nCybercriminals have been scraping OpenAI API keys and sharing them on social platforms, allowing unauthorized users to access associated accounts and potentially incur large bills for the owners. Over 50,000 publicly leaked OpenAI keys have been identified on GitHub alone, making OpenAI developer accounts the third most exposed in the world.\n\n**Swiss Government Targeted by Series of Cyber-Attacks**\n\nThe Swiss government experienced a series of cyber-attacks, with the websites of federal agencies and state-linked companies being inaccessible. The attacks were claimed by a pro-Russia threat group called NoName.\n\n**Hackers steal $3 million by impersonating crypto news journalists**\n\nA hacking group known as 'Pink Drainer' has stolen approximately $3 million worth of digital assets by impersonating journalists and conducting phishing attacks on Discord and Twitter accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc80 Threat Actors**\n\n**'Asylum Ambuscade' Cyberattackers Blend Financial Heists & Cyber Espionage**\n\nA cybercrime group named \"Asylum Ambuscade\" has been linked to both financially motivated attacks and advanced persistent threat (APT)-like espionage activities. The group uses custom malware variants named SunSeed and AHKBOT. Researchers believe the group is a cybercrime group involved in occasional cyberespionage activities.\n\n**BlackCat ransomware fails to extort Australian commercial law giant**\n\nAustralian law firm HWL Ebsworth has confirmed that its network was hacked by the ALPHV ransomware gang, also known as BlackCat. The gang has published stolen data and is threatening to leak more unless their extortion demands are met.\n\n**Russians charged with hacking Mt. Gox crypto exchange, running BTC-e**\n\nRussian nationals Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner have been charged with the 2011 hacking of the leading (at the time) cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and the laundering of around 647,000 bitcoins they stole.\n\n**Ukrainian hackers take down service provider for Russian banks**\n\nA group of Ukrainian hackers known as Cyber.Anarchy.Squad claimed responsibility for a cyber attack that took down Russian telecom provider Infotel JSC. The attack disrupted connectivity services between the Russian Central Bank and other banks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Malware / Threats / Vulnerabilities**\n\n**Minecraft Community on High Alert as Malware Infects Popular Mods**\n\nThe Minecraft community is on high alert as a malware called \"Fracturizer\" infects popular mods on the CurseForge platform. Researchers have classified the malware as highly dangerous, and players are advised to avoid downloading new mods until a solution is found. CurseForge has released a tool to detect infected mods and suspended accounts associated with the malware. The malware exploits the modpack system in Minecraft to rapidly spread itself.\n\n**New MOVEit Transfer critical flaws found after security audit, patch now**\n\nProgress Software has warned customers of critical SQL injection vulnerabilities in its MOVEit Transfer managed file transfer solution. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to steal information from customer databases.\n\n**Fortinet fixes critical RCE flaw in Fortigate SSL-VPN devices, patch now**\n\nFortinet has released firmware updates for its Fortigate SSL-VPN devices to fix a critical remote code execution vulnerability. The flaw could allow unauthorized access via VPN, even with multi-factor authentication enabled. Users are advised to update their devices immediately.\n\n**Strava heatmap feature can be abused to find home addresses**\n\nResearchers have discovered that the heatmap feature in the fitness-tracking app Strava can be exploited to identify users' home addresses. The feature aggregates user activity data and can potentially be used to track and de-anonymize individuals. Strava users are advised to review their privacy settings and consider opting out of the heatmap feature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udcb9 Trends / Events / Other News**\n\n**City of Dallas Still Clawing Back Weeks After Cyber Incident**\n\nThe city of Dallas has made significant progress in restoring its networks. 90% has been restored, but some services such as the Dallas Public Library remain in the process of being restored and upgraded.\n\n**Google Launches Framework to Secure Generative AI**\n\nGoogle has introduced the Secure AI Framework (SAIF), a conceptual framework to help secure generative AI technology. SAIF aims to mitigate risks specific to AI systems and includes principles such as extending detection and response, automating defenses, and harmonizing platform-level controls. Google also plans to publish open-source tools to put SAIF into practice and expand its bug hunter programs to incentivize research on AI safety and security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI write these summaries as part of weekly newsletter I send out, so any feedback on the length/content/style is also appreciated.

Hopefully this helps!\n\n**Edition: 05.06.2023**\n\n\ud83d\udd13 **Cyber Attacks**  \n|  \n**9M Dental Patients Affected by LockBit Attack on MCNA**  \nMCNA Dental suffered a LockBit ransomware attack earlier this year, exposing sensitive data of nearly 9 million clients. The data, including personal and medical information, was leaked online by the ransomware group. MCNA is offering identity theft protection services to affected individuals.  \n|  \n**Atomic Wallet hacks lead to over $35 million in crypto stolen**  \nThe developers of Atomic Wallet are investigating the theft of over $35 million in cryptocurrency from users' wallets. The wallet has taken down its download server and is working with security companies to investigate and block the stolen funds.  \n|  \n**\ud83d\udc80 Threat Actors**  \n|  \n**Russia says US hacked thousands of iPhones in iOS zero-click attacks**  \nRussian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says some iPhones on its network were hacked using an iOS vulnerability that installed malware via iMessage zero-click exploits. Russia blames these attacks on US intelligence agencies.  \n|  \n**NSA and FBI: Kimsuky hackers pose as journalists to steal intel**  \nState-sponsored North Korean hacker group Kimsuky has been impersonating\u00a0journalists and academics for spear-phishing campaigns to collect intelligence from\u00a0think tanks, research centers, academic institutions, and various media organizations.  \n|  \n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Malware / Threats / Vulnerabilities**  \n|  \n**Crypto Discord Communities Targeted by Malicious Bookmarks & JavaScript**  \nCybercriminals are targeting crypto-based Discord communities by hijacking admin accounts and stealing cryptocurrency funds. They use malicious bookmarks and JavaScript to execute the attacks, tricking users into executing the code disguised as harmless browser bookmarks.  \n|  \n**Gigabyte firmware component can be abused as a backdoor**  \nResearchers have discovered that the UEFI firmware in Gigabyte motherboards can be exploited by attackers to inject executable malware code into the Windows kernel, compromising systems.  \n|  \n**Salesforce 'Ghost Sites' Expose Sensitive Corporate Data**  \nSome Salesforce customers are abandoning their sites without deactivating them, leaving behind sensitive corporate, vendor, and user data.

Understanding the enemy makes you the best defender you can be to secure the digital world.\n\nBy knowing your enemy, you can defeat your enemy.\nIn the USA, the most senior police officers, even long after their pension, are advising residents how to secure their homes better. They come to your house and tell you where your weak points are around the house. They can advise this because they KNOW their enemy, the criminal that wants to break into the house and his techniques.\n\nTraining your cyber skills means also keeping your hacking skills up to date. To do this, you need an environment to practice in, legally and safely.\n\nFor this purpose, I have made a list of websites you can visit and practice your cyber skills. Every site has a different angle on the whole thing, so I'll summarise in a couple of words it's specifics.\n\nSome sites will offer you tutorials to help you, others will require you to find things on your own.\n\nI will update the list regularly and add sites to this post so bookmark it to see the latest overview.\n\nIf you are missing a site not mentioned on the list, please comment and give me the link, I might add it to the list.\n\nhttps://www.peerlyst.com/posts/train-your-cyber-skills-online-updated-joe-shenouda",

If Russ Rogers is still an instructor there, he was the head of the NetSec program. He's one of the founders of DefCon. Not sure what tuition is now, it was about $11k per semester in 2014. That was on-campus (located in tempe, az) but they also have a fully online program.\n\nI believe that Lehman College, a subset of CUNY, has certificate programs online. https://www.lehman.cuny.edu\n\nCheck your local community colleges. They typically have certification programs, such as for comptia a+. Prices are cheap (typically only 10s of dollars per unit or class), are accredited which will get you eligible for financial aid, and Pell Grant, if eligible, more than covers any costs. You'll definitely want to look at comptia N+ too if you're new to computer networks/security. There's also the S+. \n\nDon't be the guy who gets a bunch of certs to list in your LinkedIn profile. Certs don't mean a whole lot, neither does an Infosec/NetSec degree these days.\n\nI highly recommend getting on Twitter and following a few people. @accidentalCISO, @rootpoint, @AlyssaM_infosec, @hacks4pancakes, @UK_Daniel_Card, @MalwareJake, @SwiftOnSecurity, @litMoose, @Azeria, to name a few. Feel free to drop me a follow as well: @technofic_us. My feed and people I follow provide a pretty good, extensive feed. It's a beautiful mix of shit posting, quality infosec information, job leads, and other stuff. The #infosec community on Twitter (aka TwitterSec) is a good group of people for the most part. I can't think of most names off the top of my head but I listed a few of my favs. If you check out those people and the people they follow or who reply to their tweets, are usually people worth following.\n\nWelcome to the beginning of the end \ud83d\ude02 seriously, infosec can be a lot of fun, but being humble is skill you'll want to keep. Every answer to a question, unlocks 20 more questions, and you will feel overwhelmed rather quickly. But you'll learn that there's such a wide range, you can't master it all. It sounds like you would be aiming for Red or Purple team (combo of blue and red). Blue team is defensive security. Red team is offensive security. I highly recommend learning proper blue teaming before rushing into red teaming and \"ethical hacking.\" I'm a blue teamer myself. I never really wanted to go red/purple. But having a solid understanding of defensive security will help tremendously for offensive security. You need to know how systems are secured and how to keep a system secured, in order to properly understand how to compromise said security.\n\nit's not just about opening metasploit and running scripts on a system. You need to understand what those scripts are, what you're trying to accomplish, how it works, why it works or doesn't work. You'll need to understand what an APT is, pivoting, how firewalls and ACLs work, how containers work and jails, etc.\n\nThere are many great CONs (conventions) and many areas have local groups. There are workshops, talks, etc. There are often CTF events (capture the flag) which require maneuvering through a series of intentionally exploitable systems that test various skills to collect bits of information that lead you to the next system or clue. There are also practice VMs that exist for people to hack into, open faced on the internet. Some are completely virtualized virtual environments. In other words you're not actually hacking into a system but rather a program that simulates various VMs. There are sites that offer this, along with giving specific goals and hints on how to achieve the goal. \n\nDon't get discouraged. There are definitely groups of elitists who will try to gatekeep and discourage you or tell you how great they are or how ungreat you are. Infosec is a huge melting pot of every kind of \"hacker\", from coders and professional C-levek execs (like CISOs), to grey and even black hat hackers who feed their egos. Find your niche, find the color wheel of infosec (explains the various color teams and what they do, like dev ops, analysts, defensive and offensive security, IT, etc).\n\nHope this info helps you out. Feel free to dm me on Twitter if you have some questions and I can point you to more resources.\n\n-technotic",

Classes are online and can go up to PhDs for many of the universities. No \"University of Phoenix\" scam here, these are all regionally-accredited, major universities. The program's requirements mean that those schools have to stay up-to-date in their cyber-security courses to stay accredited and I've even known people who got hired through the program. I'd highly recommend you look through those, as you might also be able to get financial aid as well, although the classes shouldn't break the bank either.\n\nThe list is always growing, so it'd be pointless to list them out, but you can read up about it, find out the requirements for schools to qualify, and which schools are a part of it below:\n\n[https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/)",

You can make a corporate policy, but if that just pushes people off to their personal devices that could make it even worse as you\u2019d have no chance of inspecting that traffic and getting access to the machine is a lot more difficult both legally and technically. \n\nThe best technical controls are likely inspection and DLP, but I haven\u2019t seen any of my clients even begin to tackle this yet.

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right or not though. From what I\u2019ve read, they\u2019re using peoples entries as part of their learning tool so I think I\u2019m right in saying that.

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\n**Repost from:**  [https://www.netragard.com/protecting-your-business-from-your-remote-workforce/](https://www.netragard.com/protecting-your-business-from-your-remote-workforce/) \n\nA significant portion of your workforce is currently moving to perform full- or part-time remote work as a result of COVID-19.\u00a0 As you modify your business processes and workflows to accommodate this change, it\u2019s important to understand how remote work affects your cybersecurity posture and what openings and opportunities exist for cybercriminals to take advantage of you.\u00a0 We would like to take this opportunity to provide advice on how to orient your security posture to account for this increased threat vector and illustrate several common patterns of weakness.\n\n## VPNs\n\nLong touted as the safest and most-reliable way to enable remote work, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow a user to access internal enterprise resources and applications from any internet connection.\u00a0 VPN connections are encrypted, preventing untrusted network operators (such as your local coffee shop) from snooping on sensitive traffic, but they don\u2019t solve every security problem.\n\n### Risks:\n\n* VPNs weaken the network boundary by allowing additional devices into the most vulnerable part of a company\u2019s IT infrastructure \u2013 its internal network\n* Compromised user accounts can give attackers direct access to many internal resources\n* Granting VPN access to untrusted devices is equivalent to plugging that device directly into your network, along with any infections it might have\n\nThe more users which utilize your VPN, the more likely it is that you are giving an attacker access to your internal network by way of a compromised user device.\u00a0 When VPN is allowed on non-corporate provisioned machines, this risk is even greater.\u00a0 If an attacker does gain this access, it can be devastating because frequently internal enterprise networks are the most vulnerable parts of an enterprise network.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n* Create a separate User Account specifically for VPN access for each user\n* Place VPN user accounts into a restricted Organizational Unit with as few privileges as possible. For example, if you run Citrix, only allow VPN user accounts to sign onto Citrix desktops.\n* Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all users and VPN user accounts to increase difficulty for attackers\n* Install a Honeypot on your internal network to help identify suspicious network activity coming from one remotely connected device\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8cgb4y0hon41.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b433e9db0f97d33e25dda119cacb0285f27a203\n\n### A Note on VPN Configurations:\n\nVPNs also have the option to perform Full or \u201cSplit\u201d tunneling.\u00a0 Full tunneling forces all network traffic to go over the VPN connection including traffic unrelated to the corporate network such as YouTube or Skype. \u00a0\u00a0In a split tunnel VPN, only traffic destined for internal corporate services directly would travel over the VPN connection.\n\nSplit tunnel is therefore less secure than a full tunnel configuration because in a full tunnel your remote users will still be protected by your existing network security appliances such as content filters and/or next-gen firewalls.\u00a0 This comes with an expensive tradeoff, though \u2013 you must have enough bandwidth to serve all your users browsing habits!\n\n## Two Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nIt\u2019s extremely important that you have 2FA deployed within your organization.\u00a0 It helps prevent compromise when user credentials are leaked as a part of a breach and makes it more difficult to obtain user credentials through phishing attacks.\u00a0 With that said, you should be aware that 2FA is not a silver bullet for protecting user credentials on all services because 2FA can be bypassed when user devices have been compromised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jxvkig3hon41.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=6acd63825a1ea6ddec282b487e020fc9f08f4c2c\n\n### Risks:\n\n* Compromised devices which are used to prompt the user for a 2FA token may relay the token to an attacker\n* Compromised devices may allow an attacker to steal session information and impersonate affected users\n\nAs an example, by stealing/intercepting a session cookie for a service to which the user has already authenticated, an attacker may gain direct access to the application without needing to authenticate. Many applications (e.g. Cloud-Based email, Collaboration tools) do not tie their session cookie to a single device/source IP/location because if they did, roaming mobile users would have to reauthenticate as their device switches from WIFI to 4G or 5G connections. As a result, it is usually possible for an attacker to reuse the same session as a legitimate user.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n* Monitor your application logs for access from suspicious geographical locations unrelated to your typical user or business locations\n* Do not share sensitive information such as passwords in email or chat\n* Train your employees to report suspicious activity such as disappearing incoming email, email switching from read to unread without explanation, or password reset emails\n\n## EndPoint Security:\n\nWhen your users work from home, they have a greater exposure to cybersecurity threats because inevitably they will be using their devices for both business and pleasure.\u00a0 This increased usage is even more dangerous when paired with a split-tunnel VPN which does not force browser traffic to flow through enterprise security appliances and controls.\n\n### Risks:\n\n* Antivirus/Antimalware solutions can be bypassed more easily as users are outside of the protections of enterprise networks\n* Traffic visibility may be significantly reduced\n* Users will use their devices for personal browsing/activities which increases their exposure\n\nSince your users will be using their devices more (regardless of it they are corporate or personal) they will be more likely to encounter more threats, making patching and antivirus updates critical but potentially unreliable if you do not use a VPN or allow personal devices on the network.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n* Provide up-to-date devices configured with more aggressive security profiles to high-risk individuals such as Executives and Executive Assistant staff\n* Closely monitor inbound and outbound connections on your remote devices\n* Step up social engineering defense training to help combat COVID-19 related scams\n* Educate your employees not to store or share credentials outside of password safe solutions such as 1Password, Keepass, Lastpass, or Dashlane.\n\n## Final Words:\n\nEven when lockdowns and restrictions around the coronavirus are lifted, the volume of remote workers is likely to increase.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve shown, remote users are under an increased risk because they are outside of enterprise security appliances, encountering more threats by utilizing the same devices for both business and pleasure, and aren\u2019t necessarily covered by existing security controls.\u00a0 With this in mind, it\u2019s important to be proactive and set up increased logging, provide updated and secured devices to high-risk individuals within your organization, and limit the access that users have through VPN connections.\n\nWe hope that you stay safe, both online and off, and that you keep us in mind if you\u2019re seeking to audit your remote worker security solutions.\u00a0 In the coming week, we will be providing pricing packages specifically designed around auditing remote work solutions.",

Dave covers how he goes about conducting his tests, from scope to report, and concludes with a brief history and current state of the industry.\n\nInfoSecJon.com is a career advice site dedicated to helping people start or grow their InfoSec careers. If you're want to write a guest post, we are looking for people to write about cybersecurity roles.",

A lot of people, myself included, look for some mix of technical background, formal education (degree work), informal education (ojt, volunteer work, training classes that arent for college) and certifications. In a few my of articles, I write about how security jobs are like a highter tier job within the greater IT field, so 'entry-level' security work isn't REALLY 'entry-level' at most companies.\n\nThere's loads more on my site and I'd love to answer any more questions.

Some places hire people as interns for a lower wage and train you, or just call it jr and train, and others expect their 'entry' level analysts to have experience. some places dont have any junior analysts because they expect an analyst to have this knowledge. i always say that you have a 0% chance of getting he job if you don't apply, and it's always greater than 0% when you do apply, but i also preach to have proper expectations about what companies are looking for.\n\nI love mock interviews, i feel they really help people who are otherwise nervous get through them. i always felt i was good at them too, but id often make mistakes because i would talk too much, or not answer a question directly. I'm trying to think of an effective format to record mock interviews, but i think the best way is a podcast and i am not setup to start one yet. stay tuned!",

I always tell people to treat cybersecurity work as a higher tier, the 'entry-level' jobs for cyber security, usually require some prior work experience in security or IT. For me, when i completed my associates degree, I got my sec+ and thought I'd be good to go. I'm a vet, so i had access to resources most people don't have and got a great mentor. She set me up with a  5 year plan which had me getting varied experience with help desk, system administration, network engineering, and system engineering before i got into security.\n\nAny entry-level security job requiring a cissp is a place you might not want to work for. In some cases, they are looking for unicorns, or looking for a very experienced professional who will accept lower pay. Same goes for cism really. They are management level certifications! lol.\n\nYou want a job that wants people to have or be working towards things like sec+, ceh level.\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, I love to say that you have a zero % chance of getting a job you don't apply for. Every org. can be different, and while HR doesn't know what they want, the hiring manager might like you. I'd say its a low chance, but if you understand that, and still want to apply, that's good.",

This time, however, the officer had also attached the personal email addresses of about 150 other people who had also lodged complaints.\n\nThe leak was first reported by Gizmodo, which was told by police that \u201cat face value, it appears be an administrative error\u201d and that they would \u201cdiscuss with those whose email address was shared with the individual\u201d.\n\nBut victims of the leak say they have still not been contacted about the privacy breach and are considering taking the matter to the NSW information and privacy commissioner.",

I definitely understand that scam emails (phishing, sexploitation emails, etc) use psychology to snag victims, but I did not give it enough appreciation until this set of circumstances happened to me.\n\nI'm an IT professional and an infosec wannabe even outside of professional duties. I follow infosec pros and hackers alike on Twitter to keep my thumb on the pulse as much as I can. I listen to infosec podcasts. In fact, it was a podcast that I'm currently playing  detailing a sexploitation email that inspired me to check my email Spam filter for funny scam emails!\n\nSo keep that in mind: IT pro, infosec hobbyist, purposefully went looking in my **SPAM** folder for scam emails.\n\n...\n\n....\n\n...\n\nAnd the moment I saw an email with one of my old passwords in plain text, I panicked. \n\nIt wasn't for long, maybe a full second. But my initial reaction wasn't \"Eureka! I found one of these scam emails that uses old, leaked passwords to try to extort me!\" No, my initial reaction was that gut-sinking feeling of victimhood.\n\nAgain: *I went looking for these emails in my spam folder on purpose!* I still lost all sense of logic in my first reaction.\n\nYou and I might understand the psychological extortion tactics these emails use to trick people into sending them bitcoin. But I just proved to myself that even despite of that, my brain *still* flipped out. \n\nLet's keep that lesson in mind when we're training our users. These tactics are terribly effective. I now have a lot more compassion for victims of scams like these than I did prior to 15 minutes ago.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

Be it for BTC, passwords, or nudes, etc.. It just talks right to your lizard brain. And then once you're scammed, even if you realize it, it is hard to admit to ask for help and can end up just going deeper as with the cases of people sending all their life savings to some 419 scammer.\n\nIn my work, I take a more compassionate approach and get people to learn to question everything before responding. Let the initial emotion wear off for a minute or 5. Then do your due diligence to verify and as IT/Security provide an environment where people feel comfortable to ask for help determining if something is a legit request.

        "body": "It's a common frustration nowadays to have your mailbox filled with unwanted newsletters and promotional emails, leaving you wondering how your personal information ended up in the wrong hands. But there's good news\u2014you can reclaim control over your online privacy and remove your personal data from the internet. \n\n**Let's explore some effective steps how to get your information off the internet**:\n\n**Start by conducting an audit of your email**. Thoroughly check your inbox, spam folders, and other email categories for newsletters and updates from websites. Make note of the websites that send you these emails, as they likely have your personal information on file.\n\n**Perform a search engine query using your name, email address, and other identifying information**. This will enable you to identify any online profiles or content that may contain personal details you wish to remove. Take note of the websites where your information appears.\n\n**Visit the relevant websites and explore options to delete or deactivate your profile**. Look for account settings or privacy settings where you can manage and control your personal information. If available, proceed with deleting your profile from the website.\n\n**In cases where you cannot find a visible option to remove your information, locate the website's contact information or a dedicated email address for privacy-related requests**. Write a polite and concise email explaining your request to have your personal data removed. Refer to the website's privacy policy if needed.\n\n**Review your social media accounts and adjust your privacy settings**. Take a closer look at what you want people to see on your profiles. Control who can access your posts, photos, and personal information. Delete any sensitive content or posts that you no longer wish to be visible.\n\n**If you reside in the EU, you can leverage the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. Familiarize yourself with the regulations and use them to your advantage when requesting the removal of your personal data from websites and online platforms.\n\n**Consider utilizing specialized services that focus on removing personal information from the internet**. These services can handle the process for you, saving you time and effort. Research reputable service providers and choose the one that aligns with your needs and preferences. If you're interested in exploring data removal services, you can find a comprehensive comparison table on Reddit. The table evaluates various service providers, considering factors such as pricing, supported countries, and the types of information they can remove. **Access the comparison table using the following link:**[ **https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Vi38ZtHTyR0\\_LFEz-ON\\_RUH2ieT47z4/edit#gid=1595621103**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Vi38ZtHTyR0_LFEz-ON_RUH2ieT47z4/edit#gid=1595621103)\n\n**Remember, while these steps can assist you in removing personal information, it's crucial to remain vigilant about your online presence**. Regularly monitor your accounts, adjust privacy settings, and exercise caution when sharing sensitive information online.",

They have a comprehensive set of starter policies, programs and procedures, as well as pretty good guidance. You can choose templates based on ISO, NIST or a combo of multiple frameworks.

Comprehensive policies aren\u2019t going to do much if senior management won\u2019t support them or enforce them.\n\nI personally like NIST 800-53 as a controls framework to underpin policies and standards. Each time I\u2019ve used it to write policies & standards, I start by selecting the relevant controls from it, and setting requirement levels for the policies i.e. Mandatory, Recommended, Optional. 800-53 has 1,440 control objectives/statements in it - it doesn\u2019t make sense to use them all and/or make them mandatory. For example, at my previous company we had no other regulatory requirements other than SOX, so we went for a moderate implementation, using about 50% of the 800-53 controls. Current company has PCI and HITRUST certifications to maintain, so looks like we\u2019ll be using about 70-80% of the controls.\n\nHope this is useful in some way!\n\nEdit: typo\u2019s",

I was fairly recently hired on to design and implement IT Security Infrastructure for a health care system, along with the expected operational duties. The system is new-ish and the security program was virtually non-existent prior. \nAfter I got hired, the CIO hires an \"assistant CIO\" while the original CIO stepped back and focused more on supply chain (???). I'm not entirely sure. \nBut this new assistant CIO did not last very long. \nWe now have an interim CIO who is adept. Understands their role in relation to infosec. It seems. \nMy concern is that I do not feel confident that my direct manager is properly conveying or even comprehending what our role is, and the steps we need to mature our program. The health system is rapidly expanding and I'm currently building automations and infrastructure where there is none (syslog, SIEM, wrote an AD audit module in powershell, an IR Plan, play books, more automations, pentests and risk assessments), and I'm afraid none of this is getting conveyed correctly. I know my manager told the interim CIO when asked, what projects we were working on?,  that he responded that I was building a SIEM from scratch (it's not really, it's an ELK stack + the SIEM extension). And I'm not sure he really knows why we need one other than I told him we did. \nBtw his background is in Networking not security. \n\nI don't know if I should continue to try and instruct him (which feels backwards. I've had managers before that understood what the NIST framework is for) or seek a private session with the new interim CIO. I feel like that could be a really bad move. But I've tried to explain what we need and have even done a lot of what his work should be. And it's not sticking with him I guess. \n\nAlso, he is a good manager as far as pure management skills go. He just isn't a security professional. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be great.",

You\u2019re gathering security intelligence to identify risks so we do not derail growth.\n3. Build a multigenerational plan that identifies risks, your plan and timing.  First two phases should be solid.  Anything after that can be loose.  Like driving, you can see the road in front of you, but not the exit sign 4 miles down.\n4. Gather metrics on everything you do!

Security engineering teams usually engage very similarly to consulting companies - once the solution is deployed and appropriate runbooks and playbooks are created, the system is transitioned over to a security operations team and the engineers move on to the next thing. The \u201csecurity engineer\u201d title is consistent with you designing, developing, and deploying a SEIM. If there is no SEIM, then there are no alerts for a SOC to manage - your SOC is more likely playing the role of threat hunter.\n\nVulnerability assessments and simulated cybersecurity attacks are security assessments and inputs into a risk assessment. Security assessments identify security weaknesses & risk assessments identify the business risk (think \u201cimpact\u201d) of those security weaknesses. For instance, I recently performed a risk assessment of an e-commerce system that had a security weakness where a bad actor could exploit it to change the total price during checkout - for various reasons that I won\u2019t discuss here, the business impact was negligible and the business risk was low. \u201cSecurity Engineer\u201d isn\u2019t a proper title for folks in those types of roles because they aren\u2019t designing, developing, and deploying security capabilities. Security analyst or security tester is a more appropriate title.\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve told me, your role is the latter - security tester - and you are temporarily acting as a security engineer building that SEIM. Titles often deviate from roles because of HR red tape - I have several security testers working for me who have \u201cbusiness analyst\u201d as their HR title.\n\nTitle aside... now that I understand your role, I can give you the requested advice.\n\nThe advice is simple: Speak in business friendly terms.\n\nThis means that you never use the term \u201cvulnerability,\u201d but use \u201cweakness\u201d instead. You replace the term \u201ccontrol\u201d with \u201csafeguard.\u201d You don\u2019t ever say \u201csecurity risk\u201d because you speak about \u201cbusiness risks (that happen to be related to cybersecurity matters).\u201d \n\nThis means that you exclude technical terms when discussing security weaknesses - instead of \u201cParter company X has a bad SPF record in DNS, so our e-mail filter can\u2019t flag fake emails marked with a company X address for the sender...\u201d you explain \u201cPartner company x\u2019s e-mail server is configured in a way that allows us receive fake e-mails that appear to be from them.\u201d\n\nThe NIST CSF has a great business friendly lexicon that can help cybersecurity folks speak in business friendly terms, it\u2019s worth a review & reviewing it is my suggestion.",

For instance I recently did an assesment including pentest and secure code review for a y combinator start up, and I have an independent contract with a known aerospace company coming up that involves an assessment. But I also don't have 10+ years. I have half that. And yes, my main experience is more on the \"tester\" side of healthcare IT. I have spoken at bsides and IEEE on hardware re within the medical device context . But I have also worked as an analyst for an MSSP and did build out infrastructure. So you were correct earlier, this is also an analyst thing (I just typically do not see analysts involved in this). Either way, whether my job title is correctly classified by the HR is besides the point. \nWhile I understand organizations may have a better distribution of roles (I've worked at one) many engineers and analysts do wear multiple hats.\nI was brought on by a vCISO, consulting, to handle the strictly engineering part. My contract was bought out. I opted for this because I was/am okay with maturing a program. \nOur third-party SOC is only able to see what comes off an IDS across the org. Think something like Security Onion + 24/7 SOC analysts. I know this does not constitute a SIEM and I know we need a fully functional SOC in house. My direct manager doesn't fully understand this. Or for instance why I am requesting a road map and our needs brought up to the CIO. \n\nThe problem I am looking to answer isn't what are my duties, but how do I fix a perceived communication fail between engineer -> mid mgmt -> upper mgmt?\n\nI like your advice on adopting the business lingo. \nPerhaps my technical explanations aren't easy for my manager to translate. If I give him an already translated explanation, it could help keep the line clear. \n\nLet me ask you this: what do you expect in an IT Security Manager? It could be that I am simply not understanding THEIR role. \n\nI definitely find your pointers helpful. I'm not pushing back, only clarifying.",

I have access to several self-paced training materials including CBT Nuggets, FedVTE, and LinkedIn Learning / Lynda.\n\nI've also built a small lab at home and work with a couple of our security analysts pretty regularly. \n\nLooking for:\n\n1.  Anything else I should consider adding to my prep\n2.  Feedback on the test itself from anyone who has taken it in the last 6-9 months\n3.  Good practice exams\n4.  Pitfalls to avoid\n\nThanks!",

Did have a lot of situational \u201cwhat should you do\u201d choose the best answer questions. \n\nIt\u2019s been three years but I do remember something about type of glass on a door and height of lights in a parking lot. Related to physical security I guess. I think I remember those because I wasn\u2019t expecting them.   \n\nNot sure how the test has changed since then.  \nI was working and had experience with the DoD so security was part of my every day existence. My employer paid for 10 of us to take a week long boot camp and test the day it finished. Three of us passed. I did sleep in my office all week to be free of family and life distractions. There I studied about 4 additional hours every night before crashing. \n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t really answer your questions since I took it several years ago. But I wanted to convey the need for dedication to the cert. I didn\u2019t use any practice tests either btw so I went in kinda blind as to what types of questions I would see. ",

I myself have around 15 years of experience in ITSec, got into it from IT, started with ethical hacking, then switched lanes to cybersec. Had experience with SCADA security, military SOCs, fintech and all of that. Have CISSP, in a few days will get CCSP, and a plethora of other certificates (SEC+,network+,CCNA,CCNP,MCSA,MCSE,HP ATP, ITILv3, etc.) So I am quite in my golden years of ITSec career. I am a recent migrant to Canada from Russia (3 years), and currently work for a large fintech company, but sometimes I got a feeling that I am not working at my full capacity.\n\nMy roles include but not limited to vulnerability modeling, orchestrating pen test teams, SIEM teams, profiling threats and mitigations applicable (in terms of risk tolerance), dataflow mapping, and SME consultation. \n\nThe thing is, even before pandemic, when I was given a task with a deadline, I usually complete it waaaaay before deadline, I don't submit my work immediately upon completion, but close to a deadline. Still, I get a feeling that I don't get enough tasks. Asking for additional tasks is not an option, because usually then management gives me a task that not entirely suits my expertise (for example mapping all logging requirements across all products - it's exteremely mundane and have little reward - there are established policy and contract which states exactly what should be collected) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is - do you guys living in western world have more work to do? Or is it the same everywhere - 10-15 bursts of work a year due to some unexpected thing (new client\\\\product\\\\etc) or do you actually have to do something everyday?",

For the latter, possibly submit for tuning the rule (but only if you get written/email confirmation of the scope of the account related to it's function).\n\nI've done it long enough that this template is muscle memory.

I usually don\u2019t advertise the low exploit ratio too much because I don\u2019t want teams to feel a lack of obligation to steward their systems.   I spin it as trying to focus on what\u2019s more important first.\n\nI prioritize based on these:\n\n1.\tCan an exploit of the vulnerability lead to a life or safety outcomes? (Industry or Utility usually)\n2.\tIs the vulnerability in a system that is responsible for more than x% or revenue?\n3.\tIs the resource public facing? \n4.\tIs the vulnerability in a system with regulated data?\n\nIf one of these are true...you have to do something with it; fix it, mitigate access to it, deprecate the tech debt, or write up a compelling risk statement (that goes in the risk register) that convinces me (our risk analysts/engineers) there is no reasonable approach.  If I don\u2019t agree it gets reviewed by the security exec council that is formed by mostly non-tech SVPs/BU GMs to be reviewed. (A pretty rare event) I have placed the burden of risk at this groups feet.\n\nFor all other vulnerabilities...I provide a dashboard anyone in IT can see, BU capability leaders as well, that is used to educate them on the standing of tech in their portfolio. We track the trends associated with their systems as a measure of tech debt and make it public at big room planning summaries (quarterly planning).\n\nIn the case you have something like a Bluekeep, security pulls a crisis management cord and assemble capability leads to force patching. If they don\u2019t in the timeline identified, security will do it where we can or boot their systems (non OT/factory) from the networks if we see those indicators. \n\nLastly, we are trying to automatically associate vulnerability data with Recorded Futures threat intel data to auto generate security EPICS/governance tickets that will be assigned to teams to remediate. Then we can track stewardship performance based on that and other similar data.\n\nThat\u2019s all really.... good luck!",

Had them for about 2 years now, and very low false positive rate, also nice that there isn't a lot to configure, you just enable it and go. I will say though that one weakness is that because it's API based, if the host email platform (O365 or Google) removes an email marked as spam/phish/etc. then Abnormal can sometimes lose all the metadata about the attack as well. Also, we have autoforwarding for certain things to Salesforce and if an attack does get through to SF, you still have to go pull it out of that system manually. I've been asking them about SF integration for a while, not on the roadmap yet.",

        "body": "The Top 10 Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security\n\nAs the digital world continues to evolve and expand, cyber security is becoming more and more important. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against cybercrime. AI-driven solutions can analyze vast amounts of data, detect threats, and protect networks from malicious attacks. In this blog post, we will discuss the top 10 benefits of artificial intelligence in cyber security and how it can help keep businesses, organizations, and individuals safe. From automated threat detection to improved user experience, AI is making the cyber security landscape more secure and efficient.\n\n## 1) Machine Learning can find patterns human brains cannot:\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important tool in the fight against cyber threats. AI can provide an unprecedented level of protection to help defend against malicious actors. One way AI is being used to enhance cyber security is through machine learning (ML). Machine learning allows computers to use data to identify patterns and make predictions.Machine learning can be used to detect suspicious behavior or anomalies within a system that may not be immediately obvious to the human eye. For example, ML can detect changes in activity or traffic levels that may indicate a potential breach or attack. It can also be used to analyze large datasets to detect potential security issues before they occur.Using machine learning, cyber security systems can be trained to recognize patterns of malicious behavior quickly and accurately. This helps security teams stay ahead of attacks and identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Additionally, ML can be used to identify new threats more quickly as they emerge, allowing security teams to respond quickly.\n\n# [Read More](https://csehouse.com/the-top-10-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cyber-security/)",

These will each likely be enormously long descriptions of the controls that will be required for each category. These are the policies and you will reference the standards, like NIST, and other regulatory controls that you have to meet.

If data must be encrypted at rest, then you're going to PROCEDURALLY dictate that it must be AES256 or better, in compliance with whatever standards you have to meet.  Every policy gets its own set of procedures.  \n\nAnd then you get to do a data inventory, finding what data you have, where it is, etc. Somewhere in your policies you're going to say that if a database will be treated with the same protections as the highest classification of data within it. And you'll probably say the same about servers and such.  \n\nThen you have to look at the configurations available to you for each of the assets... and really that's going to come down to application owners, DBAs, server administration, to be able to come to the table and agree on what set of configuration  is going to meet the requirements for data protection.",

It still baffles me how some organisations are turning a lenient blind eye towards these attacks when they could easily desecrate a company\u2019s reputation and bottom line.\n\nSocial engineering in cybersecurity is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential, sensitive information. This type of attack can victimise even the most seasoned IT professionals.\n\nTop 4 tips to prevent social engineering from causing disastrous reality for your organisations and employees.\n\n* Don\u2019t open emails or attachments from unfamiliar sources. Set your spam filter to high.\n* Use 2-factor authentication wherever possible and never use the same password for different accounts.\n* Keep your employees aware of the latest social engineering threats and help them exercise caution whenever needed.\n* Defend yourself against social engineering attacks with comprehensive cybersecurity coverage.",

                "body": "Blog content (minus images and some text (maxed out at 1000)):\n\nThousands of\u00a0data breaches\u00a0happen every year \u2013 approximately\u00a0[3,800 publicly disclosed breaches occurred in 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#2ce634eebd54), with an additional $4.1 billion compromised records leading to millions of dollars in losses. \n\n## 12\u00a0Common Network Security Threats and Vulnerabilities \n\nAll data breaches and cyber-attacks start when a\u00a0threat exploits weaknesses\u00a0in your infrastructure. As a result, your\u00a0network security vulnerabilities\u00a0create opportunities for threats\u00a0to\u00a0 access, corrupt, or take hostage of your network.\u00a0 \n\nAny potential danger to your network must be considered a\u00a0network security threat\u00a0\u2013 however,\u00a0security risks\u00a0often begin with your infrastructure and its security.\u00a0 \n\n### \u00a01.\u00a0Viruses\n\nViruses are malicious programs written to change the way your software or\u00a0computer system\u00a0operates. They are designed to spread between hosts, from one computer to another \u2013 if one computer in your network becomes infected, your entire network is at risk.\u00a0 \n\nOften, this malicious software is a result of the user downloading infected application files. The subsequent infected code can spread throughout the system and completely alter the system operations \n\n[Viruses are most commonly downloaded from](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001045.htm): \n\n* Email attachments \n* Internet advertisements \n* Updating software and programs \n* Infected software \n* Malicious websites \n* Pirating music, movies, and software \n\nWithout adequate\u00a0security measures,\u00a0your network is consistently open to threats and vulnerabilities that may: \n\n* Damage or disable programs \n* Copy your passwords and send them back to their sender/creator \n* Create fake\u00a0traffic\u00a0 in\u00a0your network leading to massive downtime \n* Take\u00a0over\u00a0 your\u00a0computers\u2019 processing power and memory \n\n### 2. Insider Threats\n\nInsider breaches typically occur as a result of actions from employees, former employees, or contractors. Although some of these breaches can occur from malicious attacks by employees, approximately\u00a0[64% of insider threats are a result of employee negligent behavior](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/human-negligence-to-blame-for-the-majority-of-insider-threats-/d/d-id/1333937)\u00a0or human error. \n\nIn order to block potential security threats within small businesses, business owners must establish a strong culture of security awareness in their organization. This includes creating employee cybersecurity policies, security threat training, and the implementation of additional security software to ensure that threats are identified and stopped before a potential breach occurs. \n\n### 3. Spyware\n\nThese programs embed deep into your computer files and programs, collecting sensitive information, including passwords,\u00a0financial information,\u00a0and employee identifications. \n\nLike worms and viruses, spyware slows down your bandwidth and takes over other computing resources. It is categorized into Trojans, Adware, and tracking cookies. \n\nTrojans are the seemingly legitimate programs that may be downloaded for your critical business functions. However, these programs may carry embedded malware that breaches security and\u00a0clones\u00a0sensitive data. \n\n### 4. Ransomware attacks\n\nRansomware, much like viruses and worms, can replicate itself across the network. This malicious program\u00a0has the ability to\u00a0lock you out of your computer applications, or alternatively, out of your entire computer system until a stated ransom demand is met.\u00a0 \n\nOne of the ways Ransomware gets into your network is through phishing and spam attachments that can automatically open on your computer. This\u00a0network security threat\u00a0encrypts your files, computer, or network \u2013 if this escalates, your computer files can no longer be opened without a program key. The key is only granted when the attacker is paid. \n\n### 5. Phishing attacks\n\nPhishing is one of the most\u00a0common network security threats\u00a0where a cyber-threat gains access to your sensitive information through a\u00a0social engineering\u00a0scheme, and\u00a0is often disguised as a fake email from a recognizable source. By clicking on it, you may inadvertently share your credentials and other critical data. \n\nOccasionally, the attackers may send Ransomware or a worm through these emails, linking to a website that\u00a0has the ability to\u00a0harvest sensitive or encrypted information. A weak email security structure is the most significant vulnerability exploited by phishing scammers. \n\n### 6. Rogue security software\n\nThis software misleads users into believing that there is a malicious attack on your network. As a form of ransomware, rogue security software often convinces users to pay a fee to have their network cleared of the false \u201cattack.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nThese programs will also offer to clean up your system using a fake antivirus software. Once this is downloaded, you may end up installing malware on your computer. \n\n### 7. DOS and DDOS attack\n\nA\u00a0denial-of-service DDoS\u00a0attack happens when a threat overwhelms your network resources with traffic, preventing users from accessing crucial applications. A DOS attack eventually takes down your network through: \n\n* Excessive amounts of false traffic directed to your network address (Buffer overflow) \n* Multiple and fictitious connection\u00a0requests\u00a0 to\u00a0your server (SYN flood) \n* Confusing\u00a0 data\u00a0 routing in your network, causing it to crash (Teardrop attack) \n\nDOS attacks don\u2019t steal or damage your data. Instead, they aim to cause massive downtimes and extensive damage to your quality of service.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n### 8. Rootkit\n\nA rootkit is a threat in the form of computer software that is designed to give the attackers unauthorized remote access to your computers and network.\u00a0 Rootkits work subtly, copying passwords and disabling antiviruses until it is completely through to your network.\u00a0 \n\nA rootkit can arrive in your system through legitimate software. This malicious software can make its way into your network when you install the software and cause severe\u00a0cybersecurity risks. \n\n### 9. SQL Injection attacks\n\nSQL injection is among a form of\u00a0network security threats\u00a0where the attacker sends information to websites or web applications that are overlooked by other security measures. The attackers are then able to delete, modify, or add data into your SQL database. SQL attacks affect websites and web apps that use an SQL database.\u00a0 \n\nThe attack compromises individual\u00a0machines, but\u00a0can also affect the entire network.\u00a0 SQL and other injection flaws happen when there is insufficient or unreliable scanning of data in the database query. \n\n### \n\nIn order to decrease the risk, you\u2019ll need to engage in\u00a0[regular audits and penetration tests](https://www.resolutets.com/vulnerability-assessment/) of your systems to identify\u00a0network security threats and solutions. It\u2019s crucial to implement controls from two-factor authentication to firewalls, as well as engage in policies, procedures, and guidelines for dealing with your current and future\u00a0network security threats and vulnerabilities.",

        "body": "So, the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare happened back in 2024, and the newest info says that sensitive data has been exposed for over 190 million people in the US. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably worried about what to do next. I managed to do some research (with so many various breaches, this should be standard protocol). Here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing to protect my data, and I figured I\u2019d share these steps to help you stay secure too.\n\n# Steps to take after the Change Healthcare data breach:\n\n**1. Monitor your accounts**  \nSince health data was involved, I\u2019m keeping an eye on my health insurance records for any suspicious claims. Also, I check my bank and credit card accounts regularly to catch any unauthorized transactions early.\n\n**2. Freeze your credit reports**  \nTo avoid identity theft, freezing credit reports with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion is one of the best steps. This stops anyone from opening new accounts in my name.\n\n**3. Consider data removal services**  \nOn top of other means, get a data removal service now, because it can help you remove leaked or unwanted information continuously. I found [some good recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/TechnologyProTips/comments/1bjbfid/tpt_i_made_a_comparison_table_to_find_the_best/) for Incogni, so that\u2019s what I got like half a year ago, and it has been working very well. It helps prevent scams or identity theft, and it\u2019s an extra layer of privacy that\u2019s good to have.\u00a0\n\n**4. Use a password manager**  \nMay not be directly related, but it does relate to account passwords and sensitive information. If you want to generate and store your passwords in one safe place, and be alarmed about any potential data breaches.\u00a0\n\n**5. Update your passwords**  \nIf you have accounts linked to Change Healthcare, update your passwords immediately. Use strong combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols, just don\u2019t reuse old ones from other accounts.\u00a0\n\n**6. Enable 2FA**  \nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a must for any sensitive accounts. I switched from SMS 2FA to Google Authenticator since it\u2019s safer.\n\n**7. Watch out for phishing**  \nScammers love to exploit data breaches, so be cautious about unexpected emails or calls asking for your personal info. If it seems fishy, don\u2019t click or respond.\n\nThese steps may feel overwhelming, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. If you\u2019ve got other tips or tools that work, please comment them. There are more breaches apart from the Change Healthcare data breach, so do this for every account possible to protect yourself. \n\n# ",

Fs-isac\nOther can be found in this [list of ISACs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center#United_States)\n\nNow how the data gets used and trusted is a whole can of worms. Typically feeds will have confidence ratings and you can block off of those. Which is great until someone adds cloudflare or aws to it.\n\nI also don\u2019t care for the whole \u201cwe sync all of these lists and block them\u201d because 99% of those indicators might never be used. Possible automation would be to block the indicator once it is first seen, but if your SIEM/automation game is slow, this might not be practical.\n\nWhen looking at your SIEM, I would do two passes against your intel, first on ingest, and used to help trigger real time alarms, then a second pass after a period of time to find indicators that took a bit to flow into your systems.\n\nOn ingest you will need to be very careful of how you do lookups, otherwise your SIEM might slowdown to a crawl. If you are using MISP, you might want to sync it into a high speed lookup like redis and have all feeds normalized (ip, seenby [group x, y and q], confidence, ttp).\n\nIf your SIEM is using something along the lines of Kafka, cribl, etc, you should be able to inject docs/tables for them to do lookups on as well.\n\nFor just getting the threat feeds, a lot of people still use Minemeld even though it is end of life, there are other systems that focus around stix and taxii formats, but those tend to be harder to run. Sometimes a simple script is all that is needed for these.",

        "body": "Our leadership says we do Zero Trust at our Primary Azure tenant. However...  I just voiced my disagreement with that.   We do have next gen firewalls that control E<->W traffic between all IaaS.  We do not use Private Endpoints at available PaaS stuff (I'm working hard on changing that on new build outs - legacy stuff is a whole 'nother discussion).  For example, some Azure SQL Databases, the DBA's manage the whitelist and grant access to the public IP's of our corporate offices so corporate traffic will go out the internet and then to the Database.  Yeah, the DBA team.\n\nHowever, based on this...\n\n`\u201cGartner defends` [`zero-trust architecture (ZTA)`](https://venturebeat.com/security/zero-trust-architecture/) `as an \u2018architecture that replaces implicit trust with continuously assessed risk and trust levels based on identity and context that adapts to risk-optimize the security posture.\u2019 This means that trust must be explicit, with any request to access a ZTA resource requiring a risk calculation.`\u00a0\n\n`\u201cThe risk calculation takes into consideration various signals such as device location, believability of user assertion, device hygiene, threat intelligence, time of day, day of week, and the data sensitivity of the application being requested.`\u00a0\n\n`\u201cAccess is granted only when the calculated risk is less than the value of extending the access. In 2023, enterprises will increasingly use ZTA to enhance and risk-optimize the organization\u2019s overall security posture.\u201d`\n\nJust having basic whitelisting of E<->W traffic does not complete that definition.  If someone requests some new VM's for an application or needs to connect to existing systems, the whitelist is simply updated, many times just with an email to the right resource who can update it.  There is no continuous assessment or even review of access.  There is no risk calculation, its just done because \"It's needed\".\n\nDo other people experience this as well?",

Second the security concerns of having his environment alongside our environment. Third not having the ability to manage his rig, and not knowing if he secured his system properly. I'm pretty sure this violates NIST. But this has to affect other compliances as well, I'm just not finding much in correlation. IMO this if this is to be done it is in a different room, away from our server room, with its own dedicated connection with no correlation to our network. Am I wrong for thinking that? I don't have the powers at be to disapprove this but this is where I need as much evidence as possible to prevent this from happening, because in my eyes it is a huge risk.

Read the question carefully cause they will try to trick you. One good advice i got from a bootcamp with an instructor was to relate the questiob to the main 3 tripod: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. So you have to decide if which its asking for. For example: bob wants to back up his drive, so he puts his data on a cd and encrypts it. Which of the following is bob trying to do? A) keep his files secure. B) keep his files hidden C) keep his files the same D) generic answer.\n\nIn his case the question wording tries to throws you off by saying put it on a cd and encrypt it. So you may choose A) keep his file secure. But his ORIGINAL intent was to back it up so its keep his files the same. This would be an integrity question... if i phrased it correct. But i hope you get the picture. And i hope this helps. Best of luck to you OP.",

        "body": " The Top 10 Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security\n\n \n\nAs the digital world continues to evolve and expand, cyber security is becoming more and more important. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against cybercrime. AI-driven solutions can analyze vast amounts of data, detect threats, and protect networks from malicious attacks. In this blog post, we will discuss the top 10 benefits of artificial intelligence in cyber security and how it can help keep businesses, organizations, and individuals safe. From automated threat detection to improved user experience, AI is making the cyber security landscape more secure and efficient.\n\n## 1) Machine Learning can find patterns human brains cannot:\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important tool in the fight against cyber threats. AI can provide an unprecedented level of protection to help defend against malicious actors. One way AI is being used to enhance cyber security is through machine learning (ML). Machine learning allows computers to use data to identify patterns and make predictions.  \nMachine learning can be used to detect suspicious behavior or anomalies within a system that may not be immediately obvious to the human eye. For example, ML can detect changes in activity or traffic levels that may indicate a potential breach or attack. It can also be used to analyze large datasets to detect potential security issues before they occur.  \nUsing machine learning, cyber security systems can be trained to recognize patterns of malicious behavior quickly and accurately. This helps security teams stay ahead of attacks and identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Additionally, ML can be used to identify new threats more quickly as they emerge, allowing security teams to respond quickly.  \nOverall, machine learning provides powerful tools for enhancing cyber security and protecting networks from malicious actors. By using AI-based methods such as ML, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of cyber attacks and keep their data secure.\n\n[Read More](https://csehouse.com/the-top-10-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cyber-security/)",

                "body": "I appreciate you making the video! Of the subset of students who are interested in cybersecurity, I suspect that you will lose a lot of them in the start, because the presentation lacks a \"grabber\" - something relevant to them. Screenshots from the movie Hackers or even some notable figures at Defcon or ??? We'll proceed from there:\n\n1. Use stories with visuals whenever possible. People retain information from a story, not from a dry slide. Don't have a personal anecdote? Use something from the news. Ideally, use stories that involve people their age. Couple the story with a visual.\n2. Password security is an ecosystem. It developed over time. It's OK to explain this in a timeline format because it's all about \"we observed people breaking this so we developed this control\".\n   1. Initially you may have just had one factor to login to a system - like an \"access code\" that developed later into 2 factors - username + password\n   2. OK now people are guessing/brute forcing easy passwords like abc123 so we're going to make password complexity rules like punctuation and minimum length.\n   3. TIME / PROCESSING POWER is significant in all of this - you mention 32.23423x10\\^31 attempts - who the hell cares! It's about TIME to break. In 1994 it would be very time consuming to break passwords. Plus, almost all Internet connections then were dialup, so that takes forever. Artificial delays in the authentication process helps slow things down too.\n   4. Over time they added control after control, like a dogpile of controls, on top of passwords. Guessing too fast? Throttle it. Temporarily suspend account. Oh, then the account owner can't get in. Find something else we can use to secure this then so we don't block necessary access.\n3. Hashes are for losers! haha sorta kidding. THEY GOT IN - THEY GOT THE PASSWORD FILE!!! Oh it was hashed/salted properly so we don't have to worry about them getting everyone's password. So technically hashes are invented to CYA for an eventual breach. And to make sure sysadmins can't see everyone's password. Use real-life examples\n4. Never say when you can show. Collision Resistant? Visual. Pre-Image Resistance? Visual. WAIT - why are we going into pre-image resistance with middle and high-school kids? Make sure you're teaching to a story, so if you don't have an engaging story about pre-image resistance, it may be ok to leave it out.\n5. Cut at least half the content. The length is OK but I would suggest you weave stories together.\n\nI think it's a great effort though, and I support your efforts! Remember that if you're getting too far into the technical weeds, the kids who are \"into that\" already researched it and read this stuff. You're not teaching them. You're teaching the kids who haven't gone into the weeds and require a bit more entertainment to make the content memorable.",

This firm uses an interesting scoring methodology for assessments and vulnerability scans, which I like, as it helps give us some indication of how our program is maturing.\n\nHowever, we've gotten to a point where I feel like the value is diminishing rapidly.\n\n1) While the security assessments are fairly thorough, the resulting roadmap is just a laundry list of \"stuff to do or consider.\"  We've had to organize our own work for the most part with limited input.  I wanted someone to lead us, not stand next to us and weigh in on specific questions.\n\n2) Vulnerability scanning is great, until everyone is working from home.  More than half of our fleet is off-site so running a Nessus scanner behind the firewall isn't super interesting.  We have no insight into our most critical workloads in Azure, MS 365, and other cloud products due to their \"vendor neutral\" stance.\n\n3) They have no SDLC expertise which is one of our next hurdles as an organization.  We also have some exposure now in China, and they could only provide a few generic comments.\n\nAnyhow, I don't mean to use this forum as a place to complain about a vendor.  What I am curious about is: does this sound normal, or typical?  Should we be investing in additional SME partners, or looking for a firm that is more comprehensive?",

InsightVM from Rapid7 offers on-Prem scanners as well as endpoints for remote machines. Sometimes you have to let go of something good to find something that better suits the business.\n\nNo SDLC experience is a big problem nowadays. With the growth of Agile and CI/CD pipelines, you\u2019ll need an expert to weigh in. Consider actually hiring an application security analyst/developer, and adding them to the application team (if they report through ITSec, AppDev will just ignore them).\n\nMy 2c\n\nEdit to add: for vulnerability scanning, sometimes it is beneficial to get different scanners involved, because sometimes those tweaks and optimizations you\u2019ve made start hiding other problems.

Are you expecting the report to give you step-by-step instructions for remediation (this doesn\u2019t exist for all vulns, because everyone\u2019s enterprise is different)?\n\nBreak it down on your own first by doing some risk assessment. Focus on 3 things: likelihood, impact, level of effort/cost to remediate.\n\nLikelihood should be based on how easy the vulnerability is to exploit. Is it a public facing website with a vulnerability that can be exploited by a script kiddie?\n\nImpact should be based on how significant the threat really is - if exploited, how screwed is the company? How much work would it take to undo the damage? Could the damage even be undone?\n\nLoE/Cost is pretty straightforward: how much work or $$$ will it take to remediate this vuln?\n\nHigh likelihood/high impact vulns should be prioritized first, based on LOE/Cost from lowest to highest. These are your critical vulnerabilities.\n\nHigh likelihood/medium impact is next. Again, order by LOE/Cost.\n\nMedium likelihood/high impact is next.\n\nLow likelihood/high impact is next.\n\nThen medium/medium.\n\nMany vulnerabilities can be resolved in tandem, so probably want to pick the top 10 to put in a risk register, and as one falls off, put another on.\n\nIf you\u2019d like some further assistance, DM me.

CVSS scores are dandy until you're looking at a multitude, and playing whack-a-mole on discovered vulnerabilities.  Internally, we take the raw data and attempt to spin it in Excel until we can take sensible approaches to managing the work and preventing reoccurrence.  However, are those Java vulnerabilities really what we should be focusing on first, or is the legacy SQL servers?

These should be recorded via an exception process. \n\nThen point to the standard when things aren\u2019t patched accordingly. \n\nIf none of this is in place, you probably have a larger governance issue.",

        "body": "Hi folks ! \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for advice and opinions as I\u2019m currently looking for a new challenge within info sec but am having basically a career mid life crisis lol. A little about me, I\u2019ve been in the industry for about 5 years (27 y/o). My background is in DFIR , which is what my degree is in and, I have several certs from SANS , ISC2, eLearnSecurity, and am currently studying for OSCP. As you can see I love to learn and am happy to be in the field but I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m really uncertain of what industry and type of work I want to do next. \n\nAnyone who works in the field can probably agree the field changes so much and so rapidly. Therefore, positions /titles can be the same but mean something totally different at two different companies. Which means I\u2019ve  struggled while looking to find anything that really resonates with me. \n\nAt my current company I lead a security operations team , and am probably on track for management but am not sure if that\u2019s where I want to go just yet. At least this soon. And probably not at my current company. Part of this feeling was bought on by learning I was underpaid compared to some peers within the company that has less experience, no degree, and certifications than I do. I of course bought this to management\u2019s attention, but there hasn\u2019t been anything that came of it despite management agreeing and me having a solid justification. (But that\u2019s a story for another time, and I am prepared to leave where I\u2019ll be valued a little better ). But here\u2019s some problems I\u2019m having with just jumping ship, because after all it\u2019s not all about money. \n\n1. I have tenure - vested retirement, a ton of vacation time etc... \n2. My direct manager is great. What\u2019s the saying \u201cyou leave a bad manager, not the company\u201d. Despite the pay issue , it\u2019s not really up to her, it\u2019s more so hr and the people above her that has been the holdup. She doesn\u2019t micromanage , allows for creative freedom and extreme flexibility.  Very easy to communicate with, so can\u2019t really complain at all. \n3. First real job - this is the first place I\u2019ve worked at since college. Probably also more of the reason I think it\u2019s time for a change. But it\u2019s a big step to take, but I\u2019m more open to it now more than ever. \n4. Technical Insecurities - To be honest , I guess being in tech sometimes will make you feel like the dumbest person in the room when you\u2019re surrounded by smart people. \n5. Cyber stress - Even though a soc can be stressful, I got away from IR because of the stress that just wasn\u2019t worth my health. I was an IR analysts for 3 years before moving to my current position. So I\u2019m always concerned and nervous about going to a new company and my health begins to suffer again. \n6. Travel - I love to travel, currently travel around 10% for work, would be willing to go up to 20% for next company but again - I can\u2019t chance my health so have to be mindful of that . And all the cool jobs seem to have outrageous travel requirements (I.e. 50% +) and I just can\u2019t afford that physically. \n\nSorry for the long post just looking for some kind and encouraging words of advice. I\u2019m truly blessed to be where I am , but when you feel like you\u2019re missing something in life, how do you find it if you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for?  My fear is making a mistake and regretting it. But I also fear staying in my current situation because I\u2019m comfortable but staying in a state of not feeling mentally stimulated is draining. \n\n\nThanks for reading.",

Have long term goals sure but after a while well for me anyway, it makes no difference what technical job I did, in the end, its all the same.   \n\n\nYou can be a network specialist or a level 2 help desk person and the reality is that you can only learn so much at a time and if that learning throughput does not change then when you look at both of those positions, they are just as difficult as each other.\n\n6 months in after that initial sink or swim period from any technical position & you are going to be hard-pressed to see what the difference is between what you do now and what you did before. \n\nYou might build on knowledge over years however the actual work you do never actually gets more or less difficult. Actually I would go so far as to say that Level 3 techs have it a damn sight easier than a level one with 1-year experience.\n\n  \nLevel one has well carved out metrics that gauge their abilities pretty accurately. The problems that come through can accurately have average times attached, sure everyone has a bad day but if a level one's stats are 60% of everyone else over 6 months then no matter how many calls he/she answers in a day they will be shown the door.\n\nLevel 3 techs - \"Hey mate we got a tough one, we really need this sorted, can you help?\"  \nYeah sure, when does it need completing?   \n\"Hahaha, good one mate, just let me know when it's done, I trust you, give me a call next week, are you up for a few beers this afternoon, it is Friday after all\"  \nYeah go on then, we have earned it.\n\nLong way of saying that the guys you look up to in senior tech positions are not any smarter or harder working than you & the work they do is not going to give you sudden meaning in life. You have to be happy doing what you are doing now which sounds like you are.  \n\n\nYour drive is pretty much where I would expect it for your age, you are entering the most productive period of your working life & time where a little strategy can make a big difference in later years.\n\nI would recommend finding a decent mentor if you can, do not have to be in the same business. I joined Rotary at about that age and as with everything in life, you put in and it will give back.  \n\n\nI met the most switched-on business owners at Rotary. I realize you are an employee but that does not matter because it is not technical advice you need, you seem to have that covered, you need life advice from a guy who has been where you are & has managed to become successful by making the right decisions. It may be Rotary, Lions or something like Toastmasters. Those type of organizations attracts an amazing amount of talent.  \n\n\nThey are also usually very old and have seen everything twice & get enjoyment out of helping someone out. Unfortunately, you make these great friendships and then they tend to die which is part of the deal when interacting with guys in their 60s/70s/80s.\n\nNot sure if I have helped or answered the initial question, I got halfway through and have now forgotten what the topic was about:)",

My word was intelligent. Everyone around me picked \"teacher\" or \"mentor\".\n\n\nThis made me realize that although I am an exceptional technical engineer, I would also make a great manager. \n\nI left that company, not because there was anything bad about it, in order to pursue my goal. \n\nAs for pay, you can expect to wait a while to hopefully catch up, or interview for another job and see if they will match if you want to stay. \n\nSomtimes they have to realize what they may lose to offer the pay to match the value you bring everyday.\n\nMost of all, find what it is you value, and go after it. I happily manage multiple indoviduals now, despite thinking I wanted to switch to red team previously. \n\nGood luck out there!",

Currently there are 11 devices active. The other devices listed as offline were once joined to your network, but might not be used anymore. Or they may have gotten a new DHCP lease for whatever reason, since some offline devices are named the same as currently online devices. Many phones also use dynamic MAC addresses these days, so it might appear as if they are a new device each time they connect to your WiFi.\n\nYou have 2 networks; for 2.4 and 5Ghz WiFi. Sometimes one device will connect to both simultaneously, so it will show up twice under two different MAC / IP addresses, and two different hostnames since some devices use a part of their MAC address in their hostnames. Sometimes hostnames are randomized entirely.\n\nSo big chance is that there is nothing wrong with your WiFi.

Bonus points for changing your SSID as well. After that, you'll have to rejoin and reconfigure your devices. Each time you joined a device to your WiFi network, make a screenshot of it on your router page and see what happens; for example if it is registered multiple times on different WiFi bands.\n\nAlternatively, you can one by one remove power (not just turn off!) from your devices and check after several minutes on your router which entries go offline. If you are left with online devices you don't recognize, those *might* be unwanted; but remember that forgetting that you configured WiFi in the past happens to the very best.\n\nHonestly I'm not familiar with Ring doorbells, but I can imagine that some devices consist of several individual components, each joining the network individually during setup.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso it's better to not post those IP logs from your router.",

However it does require additional work from administrators, system owners and security.\n\nThe UK NCSC published guidance on this topic back in 2015 (I think? Around then at least). Lots of UK organisations have tried to misquote this into just \u201cdisable expiry\u201d, so be careful.\n\nNCSC guidance is taken as a baseline for lots of UK government departments and bodies, handling relatively sensitive information.

I think they rushed it out the door to compete with zscaler and others. Initially it was a huge mess and complete garbage. It\u2019s a decent product now, but is really weighed down by historical issues from its days as a DNS filter.

                "body": "Path of least resistance is with the client. If you aren\u2019t using that you need to have IPSEC tunnels from on premise going out. Then if your clients are remote that means you need to do always on full tunnel (or at least 80/443) vpn. Tunnels are limited to 250 Mbps, so many companies need to balance across several. Also the client does on device AD identify. If you are going through the tunnel and want granular user identity your users will need to SAML auth.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much config for RBI. It\u2019s pretty limited. In the rule set it\u2019s just an action. So where you say, \u201c block/allow traffic to/from\u201d it just adds the extra option of isolate to block/allow.\n\nUmbrella only really cares about public internet traffic. It assumes your internal domains and IP space are trusted. The client will ignore that traffic, and of course it would never make it to an tunnel.\n\nOn top of those methods they allow for PAC files and proxy chaining. They have their uses, but honestly I haven\u2019t seen those much.\n\nSo RBI is basic, but the proxy picks up part of what you mentioned. You can block/allow by file type. Can turn on selective decryption so certain traffic like financial and personal email is not inspected (if your privacy guidance falls on that side of the line).\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple solution. The reason I said deep knowledge or good PS isn\u2019t because the product is hard. It\u2019s because it\u2019s intentionally poorly documented. Cisco knows there are caveats all through it and the overlap of functionality between DNS and web filters was supposed to be merged ages ago but it\u2019s still not. Again, that doesn\u2019t make it technically hard. It\u2019s just Cisco doesn\u2019t really provide best practice on some of it because it\u2019s would be showing their dirty laundry by doing so. Some things are documented, just shoved in the middle of a nondescript paragraph instead of having its own page and being in all bold as a warning.\n\nedit: reading what you\u2019ve said about Ericom, you will probably be happier there. I\u2019d say Umbrella is better for an SMB with lower assurance expectations. Like I said in my original comment, it\u2019s \u201cok\u201d (now - a year ago it was a train wreck). It\u2019s simple for companies with smaller IT staff.",

I asked to go to risk and compliance and also asked if I could have a raise as part of moving to that team. \n\nThey only offered me a 5% raise to $52,500.\n\nMeanwhile a security analyst II position is getting paid 75k at the company and only requires a year of experience at the company.\n\nI currently have over 3 years of cybersecurity experience and feel that I\u2019m being extremely underpaid for my responsibilities at the company. \n\nI recently had a multiple job offers in the 80-90k range but I doubt I\u2019ll be able to lane those because of a felony drug charge on my record. \n\nI showed my company the offers and asked if they would pay me close to what I was being offered by other companies. They weren\u2019t willing to even give me a counter offer. They said they are firm on what they want to pay me.\n\nKeep in mind that they recently promoted an analyst with less job experience than me to tier 2 analyst making 75k. \n\nIs it possible that I\u2019m experiencing wage discrimination or do you think the company is using my criminal record against me to pay me dirt cheap wages because they know I\u2019ll have a hard time finding other jobs.\n\n\nEDIT: Also, I left out one major detail. When finance told me about my raise they said they are considering my Move to risk and compliance as a lateral transfer and not a promotion.\n\nI don\u2019t see how this makes sense when it\u2019s a completely different job title and vastly different responsibilities. I feel like that\u2019s a poor man\u2019s excuse to try and pay me less money for my skill set.

If you're looking more for MSSP position (which I recommend to get your start if you are in Europe - not sure about other regions though), get hands on experience with the most common SIEMs: Splunk, Logrhyth, Greylog.\n\nBuild your home network using windows AD, hopefully with some proxies, firewalls, etc. That will show your initiative and drive to actually do something by yourself. I always ignore people with only offensive knowledge (ethical hackers, oscp) because I found they are lacking common fundamental understanding and are just script monkeys.\n\nOf course this all comes from the blue side perspective.

In your position, will you be a paper pusher or a hands on admin?\nIf the latter, know the ins and outs of the 5W\u2019s for SOPs, PPGs, SSPs, how to create and maintain.\nChain of Custody procedures to aid in a high level breach.\nKnow your companies boundary and edge networks. Familiarize yourself with the network layout. What the DMZ network topology looks like. The inbound/outbound routes those devices use to traverse the network(s). \nKnow what FWs, switches/routers/WAFs/NACs/VPNs are in place. Learn their commands in CLI.\nYou must know AD if using a Win environment.\nMemorize policy and procedure for CSIRT operations.\nKnow your vulnerability scanners. Scanning policies. Frequencies and retentions.\nKnow how to run audits, and security assessments.\nKnow the differences between your security frameworks and architectures. Know the NIST 800 Series, FISMA, ISC1200, MS CIS, DOD CMMC and STIGS.\nLeast privilege and need to know. Cross training and job rotation.\nKnow about encryption techniques.\nKnow IT Security Governance PPGs. Know the CIA Triad, Defense in Depth, Security by Obscurity. \nKnow how to conduct proper user awareness and training on phishing, suspicious emails, social engineering, MITM attacks.\nKnow the ins and outs of your companies BDR/BIA policies and procedures.\nAdvice would be: Don\u2019t come off so headstrong the first couple of days or weeks in your new position. You are at the bottom of the pecking order as far as the InfoSec veterans are concerned. Coming off too headstrong can seem arrogant like a Mr. Know-It-All, and may even be perceived as threatening to some. Take massive notes whenever you can. It shows your due care towards said position.\nStack up on some certs. CompTIA Security+ is popular, but so are CASP, SSCP, CEH, CISSP.\nSubscribe to www.sans.org for their newsletters and alerts.\nLove your job. I know I do. I\u2019ve been an ISSO/InfoSec Analyst for over 15 years. To me, having a job in CyberSec/NetSec/InfoSec is pretty much a new job everyday, as you know, networks can change overnight.\nGood luck and shine bright!",

My question is, Many IT Security Consulting companies have policy templates and even some ISM's have their own poliicies they just tailor from one job to the next.  Do managers and these companies create these policies from scratch or is there a website or resource that they get templates from?  Please let me know as this company is in dire need of good quality templates and set of quality templates I can tailor would be great.  Please let me know, thank you.",

If you're still interested after that (or if you need a break from the videos), visit some interactive sites to help you get acquainted with code that will be very relevant to your work in Cybersecurity.\n\nFor interactive sites, I recommend freecodecamp.org for a good intro to web development for beginners, and underthewire.tech and overthewire.com for Powershell and Linux command shell wargames. When you're hungry for more, try hackthebox.eu\n\nThis is just scratching the surface.

I am an Information Security Analyst and I am assigned to come up with some activities to show them how the real world works when it come s to this field (the boring stuff). I want the to verify group memberships or do some easy but time consuming work but at the same time introduce them to things like Active directory, office 365 security, and other types of access. Any suggestions? They will be at the office for 3 days a week for about 6 hours a day. Any ideas on how to keep them busy and interested?",

In most cases it does not really matter (access restrictions work both for tables and databases.). \n\nAt first we take a look at how a ticket system works. The first step is that people (users) create a ticket on their local machine. This ticket (a database entry) gets pushed to a server and is stored in a database.\n\nNow we can only guess what exactly happened on the server, but basically something like this has to happen:\nSomeone should take care of the ticket (it is not a German cellphone company), so there is another database of users that will receive notifications for the tickets. Also there should be a load balancer so the tickets are distributed over the supporters.\n\nI don't know exactly how Bethesda handles this (are the notifications sent via email? On the website?) But somehow OOP got into into that second database. Therefore he now receives the tickets.\n\nThe interesting part is how he got into that database. I guess that the supporters got inserted (or selected from a database containing ALL Bethesda accounts) somehow manually.  Unless someone tried to sabotage Bethesda the mistake was probably a typo or a clicko.\n\nBut this shows a problem in the internal handling of accounts. It is a security risk to maintain both employees and customers in the same table (note: here it is important to distinguish). If the problem was a clicko it could have been prevented at this point. Also misstyping a name could have been prevented here.\nIf however it was a typo the problem might be that the e-mail address was misstyped. Then the problem is a company policy: never allow private email addresses for your employees. And a customer could not have a company address, so we would have stopped that.\n\nI hope this helps you to prevent such accidents.",

One of its purposes is filling the list of Internet domains where the illicit content is shown (gambling, drugs, porn etc). This list (domains+IPs) is spread over all ISPs and they are obligated to block access to it completely.\n\nFabula:\nAbout a week ago information about the method of exploiting this system gone wild. The recipe is simple: someone taking the expired domain from the list, fills it up with any amount of DNS A-records pointing to victim's servers and voila \u2014\u00a0this service is completely blocked in Russia.\n\nToday all online and offline card-processing was paralyzed in the whole country with this exploit.\nhttps://meduza.io/news/2017/06/09/dyru-v-reestre-roskomnadzora-ispolzovali-protiv-platezhnyh-serverov-rossiyskih-bankov \u2014 sorry, only in Russian. Hopefully, they will translate it, watch https://meduza.io/en/articles\n\nPrior to the banking system, other big resources were victimized: Yandex, Vkontakte, Mail.ru and some others.\nAt this time, there is no way to avoid this DDoS, so there is a little panic mixed with \"we've told you\" giggling among all the tech people in Russia.",

Unfortunately, I don't know who to contact about this discovery.\n\nI wanted to bring this to the attention of the InfoSec community in the hopes that someone might be able to offer advice or assistance.

What makes it even more spooky is the fact that one email conversation was only between employees and no other third party. Therefore, we assume the data breach must have been on our side.\n\nIt seems there are endless possibilities how - and especially when - the data got leaked, thus, making it like the search for the needle in a haystack. Therefore we got curius: Are there any (more or less) known places where such data may be sold/offered? This way we might be able to determine the size of the data breach and especially inform involved employees to be extra careful and not to open attachments from replies to old email conversations. \n\nWe know there exist tools like have-i-been-pwnd, however, they appear to only list compromised credentials - which is not the main focus atm (obviously, SOMETHING must have been compromised).",

You may also want to look at an AV solution that cleans rootkits. Or get some behavior based AV to deep-scan and remove it. Most malware authors worth their salt test their payload under obfuscation to see if it bypasses modern AVs.\n\nKeyloggers are usually a symptom of a larger malware. Most malware are dropped as a harmless looking executable that calls back home over an encrypted tunnel for more code/instructions. Depending on the malware, it could be a whole suite of options from keylogging, taking pictures with your camera, taking pictures of your desktop, reading your RAM (where copy and paste is located), downloading your files, reading your browsers' saved passwords (FF/Chrome), encrypting and ransoming files (ransomware), or uploading heavy amounts of traffic (DDoSing).\n\nIn the traditional sense, Keyloggers can be evaded via copy and pasting. But that assumes the malware doesn't have other means to get your data/passwords - as mentioned its not just a keylogger at that point, but much more.\n\nMost modern malware that's worth its salt will have contemplated the general means in which users will try to evade or bypass.

Today we continue our discussion of what a firewall is and why you should care, specifically focusing on what it's doing for you and what it isn't. This is going to be a very hands-on video between a completely up-to-date Windows virtual machine and Linux virtual machine. This is a very real world and a common principle used to get around infrastructure in place on many modern networks around the world.\r  \n\r  \nWe are actually going to use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability in a FTP server and show it succeeding without a firewall, then failing with a firewall and then succeeding with a bypass technique. I think once you finish this video you'll have a solid grasp on how this technology works and how it doesn't work, or how you can break it. EasyFTP is just a vulnerable app and its going to provide us the opportunity to do the same thing as netcat, but with an actual exploit. I hope you all get something out of this video, I really believe this is a core concept that a lot of people miss on their educational journey.",

Performing a cryptographic sign operation should take a constant time, and use constant power during normal operation. This prevents side-channel information leakage. The CPU should prevent repeated signing operations using the same private key. Finally, the chip should fail if attempts are made to physically access it, to prevent signal monitoring. Chip manufacturers have various mechanisms they can use to achieve this.  \n  \nSo cloning isn't easy - you would need to figure out a way to extract the private keys, which is the one thing the hardware key is designed to prevent.

Feel free to tag me and a couple of those people I mentioned, you'll get some retweets I'm sure, and some variety of answers. At the very least, you'll learn top quality shit posting. \ud83d\ude1d But, for example, there were too quality teardowns and analyses of the Solar Winds \"incident\" (read as \"solar dumpster fire\") posted all over from so many different viewing angles.

Went to 2 schools and never finished my degree. Does that mean you shouldn't? No. But building experience, being self driven and trying to learn the right things with the right techniques and methods are very important. Find the part of infosec/IT that you feel drawn to. It's okay to not know at first. But don't ever expect to be a master of \"infosec\". Learn the segmentation of it, what the different team colors mean and what they do. It will help you figure out which direction you want to go. I personally found my calling to be defensive security (blue team). There's red, purple, green, yellow, white... I'll include the color wheel. It's not important itself. But it's useful to understand just how wide the scope of infosec is, and to distinguish how it all fits together.\n\n[Infosec Color Wheel](https://images.app.goo.gl/2Bkgn21uDMYXRkxf8)\n\nIf you want some links, more specific questions, or whatever, feel free to DM me ... It's always great to see new people, especially Zoomers, showing a true interest in InfoSec and not \"I want to be a cool hacker so I can steal moneys and change grades\".\n\nIf you find my info in another post, there's some helpful info there too.\n\n\nMichael",

The system will be STIGed and I need to map the vulnerability IDs from the STIG to their applicable controls in my traceability matrix. Anybody know the quickest way to do this? My current plan is to open the STIG in the STIG viewer, where each V-ID lists the controls it applies to, but that seems like it'll take a while.\n\nThanks!",

It's part of the new release of the Perseus Incident Response Splunk App I built and spoke about at Splunk .conf19.

Perseus has helped me significantly with my own IR work, but I'd love to get input from other analysts on how I can make it even more useful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I think playing with the Splunk App is the best way to get a feel for Perseus, if you aren't in a position to test out the app but are still willing to share your input, I have a video of how I used the newest dashboard in an investigation of a server infected with ransomware that employed anti-forensic techniques on disk: https://youtu.be/haLcPIIZyo4\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThank you very much for any feedback you can give!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJoe",

In my recent student days, I was the weirdo who like governance and compliance, so I was reading stuff like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI compliance to be more marketable in that area.

        "body": "Firstly, apologies if you have seen this message in multiple places. I have post across a number of similar subreddits. \n\nOver the coming weeks/months I will be conducting a research project (around 15-20k words) to conclude my information security masters. At present I have a few high-level ideas of subjects that interest me, mainly surrounding either cyber/info sec risk management or cyber crime. I don\u2019t however know how I could build on them to the depth of 15k+ words and what exact hypothesis/avenue to take. I have quite thoroughly browsed pages such as this and popular blogs, but am still lacking that direction I need. Below are a few ideas, I would welcome any further suggestions or expansions. Please note, I do not have a strong technical background. Thanks! \n\n- The idea that cyber risk management needs to move away from a compliance based approach (such as outdated frameworks and \u2018un-agile\u2019 working) to a more pro-active approach (that approach I am not entirely sure on!)\n\n- The need for risk management to become automated e.g. dashboards and real-time metrics to allow an enterprise level understanding of threats and risks. Meaningful data and information, rather than bloated \u2018paper based\u2019 inefficiency. \n\n- The motivation behind young people becoming cyber criminals (although this may be more of a criminology / psychology subject rather than info sec)\n\n- The idea that cyber crime is undermining the digital economy (erosion of trust in, and growing fear of, digital technology)\n\n- Understanding your supply chain and the complex connectivity \n\n- Blockchains potential impact on security & privacy (however my limited technical knowledge may be an issue)\n\n",

So hit your university library (it should be connected to many research databases) and/or search on scholar.google.com, ieee explore, acm, arxive, etc.\n\nSearch for different keywords, collect new keywords (often found at the end of research abstracts), limit your search to a 3-5 year span so you work with current research.\n\nAlso, by doing it this way, you easentially get a lot of material for an entire chapter in your thesis (all thesis projects needs to have a literature review chapter).

I did not change any settings, I did not view any Facebook profiles, I never searched anything.\n\nAlso, I only use Facebook in Chrome's incognito mode, which destroys all cookies, so Facebook can't track my usage on sites that have Facebook interactions. I also closed the incognito browser before creating this account.\n\nThe only thing that links my main account to the alt account is the images, which were pulled from Facebook and would have been processed by the facial recognition and image identification algorithms.\n\nIt is my claim that any images uploaded to Facebook are compared against all know image data, and they then try to determine who you are. I assume since the 8 images only had my face, they assumed it must be me creating another account.\n\nSince creating the account, I've received 5 emails a day, roughly 8 hours apart that each contain 10 names of friends from my real account.\n\nAll 50 suggested friends are friends from my real account, there are no random people.

Signal cannot guarantee anything that is happening over Bluetooth. That is up to the security of the Bluetooth device(s).

Also, it might be important to understand that they are not breaking the encryption \"between\" you and your partner, they fool your phone to establish a secure line to THEM, and vice versa for your intended partners phone. Safety numbers verify that you are in fact encrypting your stuff to the intended person. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\n\nAlso, safety words are meant for being used during a phone call. They are displayed after the \"handshake\" process in the beginning of the call and are meant to be read aloud over the phone. The caller says the first word, and the called person respond with the second. If both agree, the line is secure.

I\u2019d you\u2019re comfortable with that, and your personal risk tolerance aligns, it can be fairly rewarding. However, you do need to make sure you do a few extra things to protect yourself (and these aren\u2019t unique to any security management role, but definitely more important when you\u2019re the one the board wants to throw under the bus:\n\n1) document decisions and actions. Get it in writing and keep copies. If you identify/become aware of a major risk, communicate it upwards/to a board and they chose not to action it, ensure they understand that this is a de-facto acceptance of risk and ensure that acceptance is documented (if you can) either in the appropriate forum\u2019s minutes or in a well communicated email chain. Don\u2019t have to be aggressive about it, just a simple statement of fact for example \u201cboard determined that funding for an improved PAM solution as a mitigation for misuse of administrative accounts and accesses by the IT department was excessive and not commensurate with the impact/likelihood of an exposure\u201d..(ok, that implies a lot, but the idea is you\u2019ve championed the assessment, assured its accuracy to your satisfaction and can defend it, have others who agree that the methodology and output is credible etc) and establish an understanding that this constitutes a risk acceptance by someone other than you. Go a step forward and try to get an actual risk acceptance in place, but you probably won\u2019t success because the higher up you go the harder it is to get someone else to take ownership\u2026because that\u2019s your job and why they pay you big bucks. (You\u2019ll still get thrown under the bus if it materializes, but your legal position will be much stronger and for example you might be able to keep your name out of the papers and whatnot). \n\n2) I said big bucks above. Because how much is your career worth and if you get defenestrated after a breach, your future employment worth after your name gets trashed in the media? If a company is offering you shit money to take on that risk\u2026think about it very carefully. \n\n3) when you hear about Ciso\u2019s getting big termination bonuses after a big event and an exit, this is usually what\u2019s going on. The bonus is hush money and living expenses for the rest of your career for agreeing to be the fall guy. \n\n4) have a network of mentors and colleagues. You can\u2019t do it alone. \n\n5) pick your battles. You won\u2019t solve everything, so focus on the ones that are going to further your career and prevent points 1-3 above. \n\n6) be the nicest, friendlies and most helpful guy in the company. Make time for everyone. Always make sure there\u2019s at least one person in a room who will go to bat for you if you\u2019re not there\u2026this can be a career saver. \n\n\nGood luck in your career, and happy to keep sharing if anyone gives a shit \ud83d\ude03\n\nEdit to add one last one - audit is your friend (if you\u2019re doing things right). It\u2019s their job to position risk to the appropriate stakeholders, so develop a strong relationship with them and be helpful).",

My aim is to finally land a job somewhere along the lines of security analyst/pen tester etc.\n\nI am not new to the field of Computer Science though, I did my bachelors in CS and now currently i am doing a security focused MS (CS)(Meaning majority of my courses and thesis are of security). I also have a professional experience of about 2 years of working as a software engineer. But after getting continuous  rejection for even student security jobs i realized that experience is really important in this area which i don't have and the only way i can replace it is with certs i guess. To this end i'm also planning to give security+.\n\nCan you people advise me something more that i can or should do to help me switch fields. I'm getting a bit desperate since the longer i have wait the more harder it'll become to switch fields.",

I am a computer science freshman but I still don't know what knowledge do I need to grab to solve these things. Please help me with these:\n\n 1. Asset Discovery Tool In an increasingly mobile world, asset monitoring is an important activity. In cases such as asset loss or even otherwise, appropriate asset monitoring is crucial in ensuring information security at all times. As part of this challenge, teams are expected to build a tool that will be able to monitor assets and be able to tell users all key information pertaining to the same. The system so developed should be able to: 1. Scan local and remote locations (using SSH tunnels) and maintain a database of last seen status, with IP address, MAC address, hostname, domain information, operating system. 2. Segregate the systems based on their operating system and AD domain and workgroup membership. 3. Create a frontend to perform various searches. 4. Option of integrating the database with ELK whenever needed.\n\n 2. Containerization of Resources Creating containers in a system helps us utilise the resources in an efficient manner, however at times security holes in container configuration can lead to compromised situations. Docker and container security plays a crucial role in safeguarding our virtualized services. As part of this challenge, teams are expected to provide hands-on recommendations to tighten the security on containers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Protectors of PII The Deep or Dark web and even social media platforms are being used by hackers to leak / sell employee / organization data. This can lead to a lot of security risks for the organization and the need to identify and remove such data is crucial in ensuring information security. In this challenge, teams are expected to identify Flipkart data on Deep, Dark web and social media platforms",

I wanted to make a post on here because I'm quite confused myself what happened.\n\nI scanned my computer today for a routine check using Sophos Home and picked up on twelve PUA registry strings. Here are one of the CSLID's in regedit that was detected \"EBC25CF6-9120-4283-B972-0E5520D00004\". It came up as \"MyPC Backup\" in the scan results and online as well.\n\nI've since deleted them but here is why I'm suspicious:\n\n* Last clean scan was two days ago, today's scan picked up on malware\n* Absolutely NOTHING was installed over the past two days, so no programs that could have bundled PUA/PUP\n* I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger to filter out the nasties while I'm browsing. Implemented DNS based security using Quad9 (blocks malicious domains before resolving them). Sophos Home has built-in web protection and I've configured it to block most categories of web traffic. I manage security on my network switch with firewall rules to block most types of malware, have an IPS enabled, and regularly check it for alerts. Out of all these solutions, absolutely NOTHING alerted me to this install and it seems to have just found its way onto my system.\n* Keep in mind: my antivirus found ONLY registry keys and no evidence of any program installer or any actual program files itself. Just the twelve registry keys.\n* This seems to be an incredibly old piece of PUA/PUP with forum posts dating back a few years ago. How has this resurfaced itself after all these years?\n\n\u00a0My question is, how did this get on my system and how do I trace it back to the root cause? I'm just so incredibly confused and would love some guidance if anyone has any input. Thank you so much.",

        "body": "Hello all; brand new redditor here.\nTo be blunt, I started college in business admin in fall 2019, and last month I decided to change majors to cyber security and Info assurance at an online university to save time and money (and land a real job) .My ultimate goal is to be an information security analyst, and I\u2019ve just been trying to figure out the best path. At my online school, I\u2019ll be earning 15 certs, which include the pentest+,network+,A+, and more. My question is about getting a system admins job as a prelude to getting a job as an infosec analyst, and if that\u2019s truly important prior to getting the infosec role? I\u2019ve seen around YouTube and other forums that people recommend doing this , but if I could jump straight into an infosec analyst role after I complete my bachelors , I\u2019d much rather do that to save time. I\u2019ve also checked bls.gov and learned that the job outlook for infosec analyst is around 32%, which is considerably faster than most careers/jobs. Is it safe to think that because the demand will be so high, maybe I wouldn\u2019t need to start at a help desk to get hired as an analyst? How much does it weigh in the hiring process if I have 1-2 years of sys admin/ help desk experience, and how do I go about getting those roles should I need them prior to the infosec role I\u2019m ultimately seeking to land in the future? If anyone\u2019s got advice, I\u2019d truly appreciate it. I start my program April 1st by the way, so any info or tips before I start would be greatly appreciated and noted. Thank you all;stay blessed.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",

This is a must for better troubleshooting in any role.  SysAdmin work will help you understand the complexities of OS functionality.  Development and programming help you to understand the application layers of how things work. While your education *should* teach you about all these things, hands on experience is best.  Cybersecurity has become a very broad field. I finally have settled into Firewalls and email security as a main focus.  I have been in the industry since 1982. Yes I am that old.  \n\nSo, what area should you focus on?  It depends on what you are passionate about. Don't limit your education to just what you are being taught in class. Join some groups like ISSA, ISACA, etc and attend their meetings. Participate in competitions such as CTFs. Attend conferences such as Defcon, CactusCon, ShmoCon, etc. and TALK to people.  When we hire people, this is something that we look at very heavily.\n\nGood Luck!",

Additionally,  every member of the hospital is permitted access to one and google  drive which combined with several hundred generic accounts will easily  facilitate to exfiltration of our patient data without risk of being  detected and to add to this we don't own a business license the users  use the personal variations. Furthermore, several hundred devices do not  require a password to authenticate onto nor do their screens fade/lock  after a period of time. Numerous members of my IT department also have  admin accounts on the EPR system which allows them to view any and all  patient information including those stored in other systems as our EPR  system has been integrated with others. The final nail in the coffin is  we use an internet facing VDI solution without MFA to directly access  our patient record system. \n\nLooking  at HIPPA its clear cut that the above is a massive breach but any  regulations that are relevant to the United Kingdom are far to  general/broad for a definitive answer. The best thing I could find is  the data protection act 2008 which states a reasonable effort must be  made to protect data but when referencing this at work im  hit with the classic \"but what's reasonable\" as though they are not  conscious of a problem. Am I going insane or is there a massive problem  at work? Unfortunately  reporting the issues to an organization like the ICO will result in at  the very least my future at the org destroyed and at the worst fired as I'm the only individual who could possibly know the information I have detailed.",

I'm hoping to get a security related co-op/internship position this summer, and another one next summer, then by that point I'll have 2 semesters left of school and I'll be graduating.\n\nI was wondering if any of you who currently work in the IT security field can direct me to what kind of skills are currently important and that I should be focusing on. I feel like my degree program is a bit underwhelming (its an amazing program, but I feel like I'm capable of doing much more since I have a lot of free time even after doing school work), and I want to keep learning stuff on the side. Late last year I got the A+, net+, and sec+ certificates (got all 3 within the last 3.5 months of 2019!), and currently I'm studying python (I did python for 3 years in high school computer science classes so I guess I'm 're-learning' python, but of course I'm picking up on new techniques as well!). I'm always reading various technical textbooks from random subject areas like networking, Linux, etc.\n\nCurrently, my plan is to get the RHCSA this summer, and then the new CCNA after the summer, so late 2020. I also want to get the OSCP somewhere down the line, most likely in 2021, as its pretty much the baseline for pen-testing (which is what I want to hopefully get into).\n\nIs this current plan fine? Or do you guys think there may be more important things to go after? Any important skills/languages I should learn? Any advice is appreciated!",

However, many accounting firms in the top 200 are trying to jump into cybersecurity. With your background, I would bet that any CPA firm with a technology arm would actually pay for many of your certs. They're literally falling over themselves trying to get their in-house staff to go tech, but most staff just want to play it safe and ride it out to senior manager or partner. Tax and A&A are, without a doubt, going away. \n\nEven if you don't want to stay with a CPA firm's technology practice area long term, it could be a good stepping stone into a dedicated IT company.\n\nShoot me a PM.

You'll be forced to branch out eventually anyway, just start learning a programming language. I recommend python for it's \"simplistic\" structure and a lot of tasks performed in pentesting, analysis, or exploitation can be automated or simplified with it.

Blocking outbound dns requests from systems that don\u2019t need it cripples a ton of C2 or secondary downloads.

        "body": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm currently in a fickle and I need some advice, especially since I don't have friends IRL  in the IT field. A bit of my background: I graduated college with an accounting/supply chain major, did a few jobs in supply chain and decided it wasn't for me. Decided to switch to IT cuz I really like tech. Had a couple of contract IT help desk jobs and because I speak Mandarin, I landed at an info security (IS) admin position at a Chinese bank, where I am right now (5 months into this job) I have no certs and have no idea how I came this far without any certs or experience and am definitely grateful. I live in NYC if that helps. \n\nI'm feeling stressed and burnt out and these are the reasons:\n\n1. There's no training. There's only 3 people in the IS team (me, an IS analyst and manager. The CISO is working on something entirely different so he's not even considered part of the team). The analyst is supposed to be training me but every time I ask him to teach me something relating to the company, he says I have to learn it myself. I can't Google things related to the company so idk how I can just learn it myself. I've read every company documentation and have taught myself new things but I'm still confused with the IT/IS infrastructure here. He also withholds info, like give the vaguest answers when I ask what he's up to or ask him how something works. Or he just says idk. 5 months in and I still have no idea wtf I'm doing. He doesn't like to listen to my boss (manager) either so my manager and him don't get along. \n\n2. The IS manager can only do so much for me because he's trying to turn the security dept around. The dept is really young, about 2 years old. Idk how a 10 year bank didn't have an IS dept till 2 years ago. Everything is so disorganized. Filing user docs are just physical papers flying everywhere when they should be filing electronically. I appreciate my boss taking the time to train me little by little but it doesn't feel enough. \n\n3. I'm currently studying for Security+ but I'm so exhausted from work all the time I find no energy to study consistently. I have a long commute too (1.5 hours). \n\n4. I've addressed this to my manager plenty of times but he doesn't want to stress out the analyst. I just addressed this issue to HR cuz I feel that my growth in my position has really stunted. He says he will speak to the CISO to have the analyst train me more. Not sure if it was a good idea to talk to HR but oh wells. \n\n5. They keep lying about my employment status. When I first started, they said I'm a 3 month contractor. And then 6 months. And now my contract recruiter told me I never had an end date?? So I'm basically full time but with no benefits. They're supposed to convert me soon but I have no idea when. They want to pay me $52k but that's way below average considering the median in NY is $62k. I'm asking for at least $55k but it doesn't seem they want to budge. The analyst actually warned me that they don't give raises - he's been here for 2 years and haven't gotten a raise or title change (I call him analyst but he's actually an admin too but doing analyst stuff)\n\n6.  I'm considering stepping down and becoming a sys admin because I'm at the end of my patience with this company. \n\n7. IS works closely with IT and they constantly ignore my emails because I'm trying to learn about the IT infrastructure here but everyone just says they don't have time. Which they really don't. Both depts are understaffed. \n\nI'm at a loss right now. I appreciate any advice or help I can get.",

If you find yourself swamped with BS work that is going no where and no one is willing to coach you, take advantage of that time and spend it learning things that will make you a better value to your company and future employees.\n\nLearn some ITSM, CMDB and other central tech that can be applied to security.

The fear is that they will train you, you get certified and then leave and they lose their \u201cinvestment\u201d. Learn some stuff on your own, become invaluable then move on. \n\nStart joining user groups, networking events, etc... look at every security vendor out there and build up your knowledge and connections. These are the people that will help you. This will energize you and help move your career along.\n\nHere is a list of technologies to look into and understand at a fundamental level:\n\nFirewalls (pfsense is free! Build out a lab using virtual box)- Palo Alto, Checkpoint, Cisco\n\nIDS (snort is free and can be installed with pfsense!)\n\nVulnerability (tenable, Qualys, Rapid7) so much to learn, just get a basic understanding\n\nCarbon Black, CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Cisco, ServiceNow, etc...\n\nKali Linux! (Learn some basic pen testing)\n\nDon\u2019t jump in head first yet, get a basic fundamental understanding of what all of theses companies do, then slowly build up knowledge. You\u2019ll get there.\n\nKeep your head up and don\u2019t let this situation discourage you too much, I know it\u2019s hard, but it will be worth it!\n\nYou can always DM me with any questions too!",

Take the job, get the certs and experience, then move on to another job if they won't give you a raise.  \n\nSec+ and Linux+ share like 75% of the same material, do both or one after the other.  CISSP looks good whether you are doing the job or are in management over people doing the job...but requires proveable experience in each area of infosec.\n\nHaving a passion for IS is important if you want to go very far in security fields.  Teach yourself and stay on top of stuff, the guy you are talking about is being a dick not training you on company specific stuff... but its possible he see's you as inexperienced and doesn't want to waste his time...\n\nYou kinda have to tough it out and get the experience under you belt...not much else to say.  Your situation sucks, but at least you have your foot in the door.\n\nif you aren't happy, and have a chance to move into sys admin instead (and good procedure docs or people to train you) then do that if you think it will make you happy.  But SysAd is kinda full and IT Sec is where its at right now.  Everybody did Microsoft Certs and stuff,  or Network certs, over the last 20 years.  Those positions are full.\n\nIT Sec in my role at least, is mostly about contract compliance, vulnerability scanning / management,  and patching.  I mostly oversea other teams doing their jobs and make sure everything is up to date and ready for audit, and am the audit focal when they happen.  I can't speak to what your role is supposed to be, the actual settings and network management should be a different role,  or are the role you are in just by an infosec title...\n\nSeriously.  Learn what you can,  get a cert or two, be ready to move on to somewhere you can be appreciated.",

What are you assessing; a system, a process or an organization/business unit?  \n\nOnce scoping is completed, appetites and thresholds need to be defined, as well as impact and probability. These cannot be changed once agreed upon, otherwise the assessment will be inaccurate. \n\nNow identify credible internal and external threats, to include human, technical, and natural threats. \n\nIdentify vulnerabilities within the scope of the assessment and develop a risk statement:\n   \u201cIf x occurs by y then z\u201d.\n\nEnter the risk into a register with an assigned Risk ID. If the inherent risk score exceeds appetite, identify a remediation and develop a Corrective Action Plan. Once completed, close the Risk ID.\n\nIf a remediation is not available, select a mitigating control and solution to add to your IS&P Plan with a Plan of Action & Milestones. Score the risk again, this will be the residual risk.  If it does not exceed appetite, monitor the risk. If it still exceeds appetite, additional mitigation is required. \n\nIf the inherent risk score does not exceed appetite, monitor the risk and conduct periodic reviews to ensure changes to the environment do not cause the risk score to exceed appetite.",

After having my daughter I decided to go back to school (expensive online school) so that I can get into a career in cyber security. Fast forward to last month. Ive been accepted into a program ran by the department of vocational rehabilitation. Ive decided to get IT certifications to supplement my income and transfer to a local community college. I have found http://www.leaderquestonline.com/, which will train me for certs to get an entry-level position in information security. \n\nWith all of this said, what are the best certifications to get for a career that will lead to me becoming a cyber security specialist? Also I would like to know if I am going in the right direction. The department of vocational rehabilitation will be paying for training/ part of school. Im not going to lie. I want to make a lot of money. I dont expect to make a lot in the beginning. How much am I looking at making starting out? I have many questions and Im sure that I have rambled a lot.

Plus multiple choice vs performance based (OSCP for example) are to be considered as well.\n\nIf I work with someone, I care about how they communicate, their ability to explain/write/structure their analysis clearly, and how willing they are to learn/challenge themselves. Certifications, to me, are nice to haves after the above. It makes hiring more challenging though.",

        "body": "Although Cyber security is a very important and common job function, we don\u2019t see the term often in job titles. Cyber security engineers, specialist, analysts and security architects are few common [cyber security job opportunities](http://www.quickrecruit.in/categories/795/cyber-security-jobs/) where the terms [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), [network security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security) and [cyber security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security) is within the title.\n\nToday we will learn more about the common jobs in this sector, the skills required for individuals to outshine as security experts, the industries that are ardently waiting for good information security professionals and expectant security trends that can cause a revolution in the jobs of IT industries.\n\n**Common Cyber Security Job Opportunities**\n\nInfact, there are a range of titles in jobs in IT that entails cyber security know how. Most common of them, according to a survey conducted by [SANS Institute of Cyber Security](https://www.sans.org/) Professional Trends, are;\n\n\u2022 CISO/ CSO \n\u2022 System Administrator\n\u2022 Security Analyst\n\u2022 Security Engineer\n\u2022 Security or IT Director\n\u2022 Information Security Architect\n\u2022 Network Architect\n\u2022 Forensic Engineer \n\u2022 Network Engineer\n\u2022 cyber Security Auditor \n\u2022 System Integrator\n\nIt is a known fact that today a career in network security can fetch you higher pay scale, better occupational growth and improved job security. Hence, it is necessary to be well aware of the cyber security job opportunities in and around your location. Security officials are high in demand all over the world, in every pioneering industry. So search quickrecruit.in listing of technology jobs to find openings with any of the above mentioned network security titles.\n\n**Skills Required for Cyber Security Career**\n\nFew of the go-to skills that every professional aiming to have a career in the information security are\n\n*Intrusion Detection, \n*Incident Response and Handling, \n*Audit and Compliance, \n*Cloud Computing\n*Expertise in Firewall, IDS and IPS\n*Analytics and Intelligence\n*SIEM Management\n*Access Management\n*Identity Management\n*Advanced Malware Prevention\n*Cloud Virtualisation\n*Application Security Development\n*While these are the most shared skills, most information security job roles require only a handful of these skills, plus other managerial, functional and interpersonal skills.\n\nIndustries that continuously deal with sensitive data and vulnerable information are most frequently a victim of cyber-crimes and attacks. While all those industries which have an online presence call for security officials, the top five industries that cannot sustain without them are;\n\n1. Banking/ Finance/ Insurance\n2. Information technology or Management\n3. Government (Defence)\n4. Non \u2013 defence Government and \n5. Consulting/ Professional Services\n6. Cyber Security Trends You Can Expect in the Coming Years\n\nMany of you may wonder why there\u2019s a sudden rise in the need of cyber security expertise. Each year job researchers and analysts sit down and come up with systematic scrutiny of job opportunities, recent trends and technology predictions that accelerate the need for certain professionals in the industry. Here are 6 network and security prediction that may throw a light on why the demand for information security experts is not going to alleviate;\n\n**1. Malwares Are Not Going to Stop Evolving**\n\nOne of the most common instruments that attackers use to reach targets is Malware. Malwares are not only common but are most effective medium as well. Because of malware propagation being the most definite attack method for the past few years, most of the antivirus product\u2019s effectiveness is called to question.\n\nAlthough, the [entire antivirus brands](http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-antivirus-software/) offer a series of protections against malware attacks we have found that not all of these defences are completely effective as malware is still continuing to metamorphize.\n\nOne of the trending malware attacks that have become quite hard to detect is the emerging memory \u2013resident malware. Unfortunately these malware do not survive a reboot and so it particularly cannot be detected forensically. But with hundred thousands of people leaving their computers running continuously, the memory \u2013resident malware could be a successful attack technique.\n\nEven attackers are evolving, soon enough they will shift to different technique such as mobile malware. Mobile devices can be as lethal as other devices as most enterprises today allow mobile phones to join the corporate network.\n\nThese vast techniques can only be dodged for some time by anti-viruses, until they are almost ready to explode and engulf. We need more protection or stringent security measures to protect us from the trending malware attacks.\n\n**2. Complexities in IoT Can Lead to Security Issues**\n\nBy the year end of 2020 we will enjoy 26 billion IP Network connected devices. Imagine that? A faster and more precise technical world. This prediction was shared in the [Cisco\u2019s Visual Networking Index (VNI)](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/).\n\nInternet of Things or IoT is the current trending evolution that has vast and potent reach to corporate enterprise networks, consumer homes and local government. However, as the Internet of Things goes deeper and deeper, the security risk increases due larger combined target.\n\nSo, why a technology as modern as IoT will have security issues and why do we need security expert to sort them out? The reason is IoT world has a wide variety of standards and protocols which result in lack of IoT skills among the enterprises, overly dynamic yet complexed architectures, products and by-products with poor security features, measures and operational immaturity.\n\nAll of these lead to more security issues; we have already witnessed magnifying DDoS attacks sourced from vulnerable IoT devices and it would be foolish to not predict the same in 2017 and years ahead.\n\n**3. AI and Machine Learning as Network Security**\n\nSecurity practitioners highly speak about the importance of visibility and monitoring with the famous quote by Thomas Jefferson \u201cEternal Vigilance is the practice of liberty\u201d. This was applicable when amount of data to be investigated was manageable.\n\nIn the modern world, with Hybrid IT environments and threat intelligence security monitoring and management has surpassed enterprise capabilities and so, to help the security vendors, and help recognise and respond to attacks features like Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning, Data visualisation and Advanced algorithms have been incorporated and advertised.\n\nWe are hopeful that these advanced capabilities by highly qualified cyber security professionals will give way to stringent solutions and real security protection measures.\n\n**4. Software Defined Networking Rises Again**\n\nThe use of hybrid WAN will continue to grow over the next several years. The SDN industry fervently wishes that enterprises will soon begin deploying SDN and start to use the northbound RESTful APIs, network programming, automation and advanced features such as multi \u2013tenancy, campus slicing and micro segmentation.\n\nMost enterprises today are technology laggards and we have witnessed many of them educating self on Software Defined Networking \u2013[WAN technology](https://www.cisco.com/cpress/cc/td/cpress/fund/ith2nd/it2403.htm). We are also witnessing that most of the corporates planning to renew their contracts on MPLS WAN and make a compelling switch to SD-WAN.\n\nWith so many changes in the Software Defined Networking, the need for Cyber security professionals will only aggravate in manifolds.\n\n**5. Cloud Computing and It\u2019s Security Be of Paramount Importance**\n\nIn the past we have witnessed several cloud security breaches and so many organizations still using security as road block and preventing other organizations from taking advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.\n\nHowever, in the last quarter many proficient organizations like AWS have made clear that security is one of their top priorities. Cloud computing infrastructure totally works on security and that\u2019s something every company would try to offer to their customers.\n\nThere are now more better and comprehensive security advices and best practices available for organizations to follow so that they yet again start their cloud computing services in a secured manner.\n\nAll this can be fine-tuned and augmented when there\u2019s a huge collaboration between cyber security professionals working towards it.\n\n**6. IPv6 is Gaining Steam**\n\nAlthough the global internet progress on IPv6 deployment has been slow but steady in the recent years, Google or Cisco statistics will reveal the gaining steam percentage of IPv6 to be rapid. IPv6 has been deployed by most providers of internet service, broadband and mobile operators.\n\nThese days there is so much uncertainty in the IT industry and it has become practically difficult to predict. We are at an early stage of IoT, AI and Automation and Performances improvements and we can only be hopeful that the advancements of these IT products create new business. But these advancements can be implemented when there\u2019s a strong and stout network of security professionals.\n\n**Let\u2019s Not Forget that It\u2019s just The Beginning**\n\nWhile we have seen a [large boom in Cyber Security Job opportunities](https://quickrecruitblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/19/a-great-time-to-start-your-career-in-cyber-security/) and the aforementioned skill sets, let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s just the budding stage in this field. It\u2019s yet to completely flourish and take over the other sectors by storm.\n\nIndividuals, who are considering this career choice, let us assure that you it\u2019s the right time to opt for it because not only will the current professionals be able to broaden or augment their skill sets with more security training, but they will also be able to collaborate and innovate without being burdened or pressurised. The competition is fierce but not amongst the network security professionals but amongst the industries to hire the best people.\n\nRight now it is one of the highest paying IT jobs due to lack of sufficient expertise and hence today is the right time for all of the aspirants. Having said that if colleges continue to expand their syllabuses and include the field as one of the prime courses offered, soon young talents will emerge and continue to fill these roles.\n\n",

All I need to do is install the lastpass plugin in my browser and login, he can share the passwords with me without ticking the *Reveal password* box, then lastpass will autofill the form.\n\n[One word: **Fiddler!**](http://i.imgur.com/xMaw3Ck.png)\n\nI can use Fiddler to see the password in plain text in the HTTP requests content, on any website. I can even do this on HTTPS websites, as you can setup Fiddler to intercept your own HTTPS traffic.\n\nYou all probably already knew this, but my point is that this is sold by Lastpass as a **security** feature. And people buy it. This guy clearly did!\n\nI know that your average user won't be able to intercept their HTTP traffic and see the password, but when it comes to security, it isn't your average user you are particularly worried about.\n\nThis Lastpass feature gives Managers etc a false sense of security when it comes to sharing passwords.\n\nI imagine that there are a lot of managers out there who genuinely believe that when they share a password with somebody, but don't tick the *Reveal Password*, then they can do it without the person actually being able to see the password.\n\nIt gives the impression that you could potentially give access temporarily, for as long as needed, and then rescind that access without the individual knowing the password, meaning you don't need to change it.\n\nNope! Lastpass would really be better removing this feature altogether IMHO.",

I stopped actively using that address years prior, but I found out those usenet conversations in Google groups (or whatever it was called).\n\nThat's the reason why in some sites you can't view the company email addresses directly and they are protected by some mechanism, to prevent Web crawlers from catching those email addresses.",

You're probably best to start putting your new email address up everywhere you possibly can; on your website, on random public forum posts, in the signature of forum posts, on fake Gumtree/Craigslist ads etc. and wait for webcrawlers to pick it up. \n\nWon't be a quick process, especially if you're waiting for a particular type of spam. Might be quicker to just advertise your site and ask people to send in the spam they receive for you to follow up on?",

[BSides Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqRlVtRYwWQ)\n\nIn the project, I\u2019ve weaponised the attack discussed during this presentation and automated it to an extent that it only requires a few clicks to perform. I\u2019ve uploaded a short video on how to use Phishious - [Phishious - Automated Scan Introduction - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9p4f6B5Ww)\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the project!\n\nRegards,  \nRices",

                "body": "Hi everyone! I am a cybersecurity vulnerability researcher and penetration tester professionally and in my personal time, I do a lot of educational outreach. Specifically with high school and middle school students. I recently started a YouTube channel to support some of my lectures in an async manner. I do additional videos like this as well to support interest in various domains. Please check it out and provide some feedback on the material and teaching style--I'm trying to improve these.\n\nIn this video, we take a look at another Hack a Sat challenge,  container name Kepler 2, challenge name Cotton Eye GEO. This challenge is designed to teach about the orbital mechanics of moving from one orbit to another and how to determine the required maneuvers (change in velocity, \"Dv\") to perform that orbital circularization. \n\nWe start with an overview of the challenge, which is an extension of the first problem, Fiddlin' John Carson (which there is another video about on this channel). We then use Universe Sandbox, a space simulator to discuss the orbital principles before finishing the video by calculating a burn time and Dv in ICRF using Python libraries: poliastro and astropy. Ultimately the whole point of this video is to teach about calculating the delta-v (Dv) required to maneuver from one orbit to another. We try to do this with as little math as possible to keep things high-level and conceptual. Hope you get something out of the video or at least enjoy the content!\n\nHere's my solver: https://github.com/nmsinger/NSL-CTF-Team/blob/main/2021%2C%20Hack%20a%20Sat/solutions/kepler2.py",

Is this just something we have to live with, as it gradually gets worse (and it *is* getting worse).\n\nRight now, as far as I can tell, your options are to pay for a subscription service to filter them, or don't have a phone number. Conditional filtering should be a standard feature available to everyone.\n\nI hope that over the coming years, businesses and systems in general will stop relying on phone numbers and instead use something else like push notifications, because right now the attackers are taking advantage of a conditioned response, people have learnt to expect texts with links in them from legitimate services. And calls from legitimate services.\n\nBut man it's annoying. How do we prevent them right now?",

However the bulk of it was supposed to have been taken down last month by Europol and others. This could be a successor taking over or an section that got missed.  \n\nIf it Is Emotet or an offshoot, unfortunately once the botnet has infected one computer and exfiltrated its email, it\u2019s out there and can continue to be used in perpetuity. It can spoof any recipient in the email thread, but often spoofs the actual sender of the most recent exchange.  Sometimes with reports from external vendors you can correlate a couple of emails and figure out the infection source(s).  It may not even be within your organization, but with multiple vendors reporting the same, it likely is. You should also be able to get a rough timeline of infection from the dates on the impersonated email. IIRC the exfiltration can go back 3 months. In some cases we saw it used right away, in others it would wait a while. \n\nThe best defense at that point IMO is good malware detection, attachment neutering, and detection and notification that the incoming email is spoofed. Rewriting subjects and bodies with [External Sender] etc. Reminders to not open attachments (even ones from known sources) and never enable macros. Coupled with user education about typical BEC scenarios, last minute changes of bank account info, one off email domain impersonation, etc. \n\nFWIW in our investigations we saw the botnet aspect trying to spread malware and phish for credentials.

About three years ago I managed to land my first IT job as a web developer by scraping all the emails in a local python jobs posting site (about 350 Argentinian companies) and sending all of them an email (1) with my CV, portfolio and github account, using a python script. I then shared this list of company emails and my script with any person who wanted to get into the field I encountered, a big percentage of them managed to get jobs in IT as well.\n\nI've been studying cybersecurity for a couple of months now while working as a web dev team leader and about a year from now I want to get an entry level job in the cybersecurity field, using a similar approach.\n\nThe problem I'm facing is that I haven't found a site that shows company emails in their listing. So what I'm currently doing is looking through many \"top cybersecurity companies\", going through their sites and grabbing their HR email. I imagine there's tools for scraping emails from those company sites, but even then the process is still quite slow.\n\nAnother idea I thought of is to search cybersecurity-related LinkedIn profiles in Google, scraping their links and then automate the process of adding them in LinkedIn using Selenium (apparently 72 connections a day is when LinkedIn starts noticing something weird's going on). My only problem with this idea is what type of people to search for in order to maximize the chances of getting a job.  \nFinally I could pay someone to somehow gather cybersecurity-HR emails, but I fear they would be facing the same problems I'm having.\n\n**Thanks for reading! Any help is greatly appreciated. I will share my findings, results and methodology here once it's done.**",

It's pretty typical in the DoD that you can't get elevated privs into a system without having a DoD 8570 IAT II qualified certification -- which for most people is Sec+.\n\nYou could be an NSA engineer and be denied access to systems because you don't have Sec+ just because it fills a regulatory requirement block in the form you have to submit to get access.\n\nSee list here: https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/\n\nA cert from a higher tier in the same category covers the lower tiers as well, so if you have *one of* the IAT II *or* IAT III certs then you are fine. Otherwise -- yeah I've seen very highly skilled people have to take Sec+ just to get access to the system they were hired to manage. And fail the test because they didn't have all the ports memorized. \n\nIt's kind of ridiculous but it is what it is. Since you mentioned future jobs its something to be aware of. How important that is to you is your call.\n\n***EDIT*** I see GSEC and GCIH are added to the IAT list now so you should be covered.",

A job posting system or HR Manager might not understand why a CEH is not really needed for a position, but it\u2019s a lot easier to explain that once my resume is past the system. I also tailor certifications by excluding some and added others to my resume as well. I don\u2019t believe that a certification should be a replacement for experience, but I don\u2019t want miss out on a position for not having one. \n2.\tTrophies: As I am not a competitive runner or ever plan to be, I also view my certs like someone may view a 10K or Half Marathon hanging up in their home. I \u201ctrain\u201d for the exam by either self-study, in-person classes, or a mixture of the two. On the day of the event, I hope to finish well enough to earn my medal for the day. I also realize that this view comes from a very privileged one as currently my employer has supported all of my exams, training and fees. If I was paying out of pocket, it would have most likely cost $20K+ and I would know have the same views. \n3.\tTangible Knowledge Gains: It would be great if more employers recognized more on demand training (Udemy, Cybrary, etc) but it is still in its early stages. In my end of year review, if I say it completed online Cloud security Training, it might it get a second glance, but if I say I completed online Cloud security Training and earned a CCSP certification, that carries a lot more weight. \n\nTruthfully in my current position, I could have stuck with my Sec+ that I earned back in 2011 and would have find certification wise.",

If reading this you already feel bored then you know it's not for you. \n\nThis is just my personal recommendation, but got to a site like pluralsight and get a trial account or couple months worth to time and watch/listen to the different cybersec training sessions.

It is substantially easier (and mathematically feasible) to \u201cbrute force\u201d the default six-digit passcode, and having credentials, as in this case, is essentially like having your fingerprint and using TouchID.  The encryption at rest would be largely bypassed by and seemingly unnoticeable to the unauthorized party.\n\nNonetheless, encryption at rest is a cheap, simple safeguard that one would expect of a financial services firm.  The truth, however, is firms can be lazy, as encryption of data at rest brings along a new subset of controls to manage and rotate encryption keys.  The loss of the encryption key would render the data useless, and for a credit bureau, data is the product.\n\nThe larger issue are the lack of enforceable, auditable security requirements for seemingly critical data, like a Social Security number.  PCI-DSS includes 12 requirements (more aptly thought of as \u201ccategories\u201d of requirements) that provide a higher level of detail regarding specific security controls required when handling cardholder data.\n\nThis means that your Visa card number has more security control requirements (albeit industry rather than statutory requirements) than your Social Security number.  That is to say, the number you use to obtain a credit card number is less protected than the credit card number itself.",

I have always been interested in computers and I have done some learning by myself although nothing too crazy.\n\nLately I've been thinking about the degree I want to take and I decided that I want to know more about cyber security and hacking.\n\nWhat I am trying to gather at the moment are sources like forums or pretty much anything that could help me getting started in this field. I have done some research but most of the sites I've found aren't very helpful, mostly you find people just asking how to track an IP.\n\nSo if you redditors could give me a hand I would really appreciate it. Everything is valuable for me from degrees you suggest me to study, resources, any tips or knowledge I might not have I seriously want to know more about it.\n\nThank you",

                "body": "I think it's a great field to get into. Some basics to address:\n\n\n* You will need a solid understanding of computer systems. This doesn't just involve programming, but also network infrastructure. It may sound daunting, but it's nothing a reasonably smart person can't learn. I would start with programming if you don't have a background. Python is a great place to start. Learn SQL. Have an understanding of web development. Use a WYSIWYG at first if needed (Squarespace or several unpaid options). \n\n\n* Move on from there and start playing around with building your own systems. Once you understand the parts of a mobile site (front end, back end, public and private databases, etc.), you can then begin to attack it and scrutinize it. ZAProxy, Burp Suite, and several other offensive security packages would be great to play around with.\n\n\n* Start doing research. Stay in the know about what is going on in the world. Listening to podcasts and reading publications is how I get 75% of my useful information. Start with Paul's Security Weekly and Security Now as podcasts. There are plenty more that you can find. This is a multi-reddit that I look at every day: (https://www.reddit.com/user/rikeen/m/it_security/).\n\n\n* Once you get the hang of the basics, you can decide what you want to specialize in. This is a great post describing the breadth of the InfoSec field: (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/map-cybersecurity-domains-version-20-henry-jiang-ciso-cissp).\n\n\nI'll do my best to summarize some different career paths in security: \n\n\n* Information Security Manager/CISO: You manage all aspects of Cyber Security in their organization. Manage is the key word. You perform high level tasks and ensure that regulations, laws, and obligations are being met. There is a lot of Policy writing/enforcement. Incident Response is also a large part of the process. You will need to understand the topic at a high level to propose budgets and projects. This is typically not a \"beginner\" role, but one you get after demonstrating competence and experience.\n\n\n* Offensive Security/PenTesting: You are a \"white hat\" hacker. You are hired by organizations to text their network for flaws and vulnerabilities. You will have a deep understanding of networks, applications, and attack vectors. Likely, much of your information will come from publications and communities as well as recent exploits. \n\n\n* Analyst: You evaluate organizational structures in detail. This can have some overlap with the previous position. You will focus on processes and controls to ensure the organization is well prepared for incidents. You also help determine areas of non-compliance as well as operational deficiencies. \n\n\nNote that this is a gross oversimplification of the field. However, it should give you a roadmap to start thinking about. More detailed information can be found here: (http://www.cert.gov.om/career_positions.aspx#.WNVTSTsrKUl).\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if I can help in any way. I kind of stumbled into the field early on and I love it.",

                "body": "Great answer rikeen.\n\nI'll add my 2 cents even though I'm in a similar position like OP.\n\nSolid understanding of Computer systems is key. Networking (understand how TCP/IP works, subnets, VPN/Tunneling/SSH) and programming (learn how code works and computers \"think\"). The latter will come through experience. Get a project and just start. Python, Java, PHP, C(++) whatever.\n\nEven more important (imho): Learn how computers itself work. Get Linux on a Laptop or some machine you can use. Develop on Linux, solve problems and get used to the command line.\n\nLinux teaches you A LOT of stuff because it's closer to the system than Windows or MacOS. Linux gives a lot of options and responsibility to the user. Also it's easier to setup Servers on Linux.\n\nBuild a little Website, write an application or manage your own little network. In such an early state, everything contributes to your skills.\n\nIf you wanna dive into attacking stuff, WiFi Hacking is an easy point to start. Kali Linux delivers a ton of great tools but I recommend at least some experience with Linux, before starting with Kali.\n\nNullbyte on the WonderHowTo network is a nice and understandable source for some guides (however they don't go too deep. For that you need more specific sources).\nPodcasts are great (unfortunately the ones I know are probably not your language :/) and reading reddit and News Websites about IT(Sec) helps a lot if you want to be up to date (you want this).\n\nInfoSec is progressing rapidly, new exploits are found, new standards developed...",

First, we thought it was the controller(s)--replaced batteries etc, then we thought it was something physical, logic board etc.  We noticed when we got closer (within feet) the door would open.  So, we figured it was some kind of interference.  We made plans to turn off all our circuits etc 'tomorrow'.  Than the night before, I heard a faint noise...  our Verizon Fios backup battery was sounding an alert.  The backup battery needed replacing. We immediately knew...this could be it...so we bypassed the backup battery and tested our controllers with the garage door--and it works again!   Fortunately, we did not get frustrated.  It was not super important to fix it, etc.  It was nice to stumble across the cause .  It definitely demonstrates how something can interfere with another frequency and is a good example or story to share when someone asks for examples of DoS.",

So unless something rapidly changes in that regard, you will likely not see a change in the way that you authenticate yourself at an ATM. \n\nHope this helps somewhat!",

Do they block DNS request? However, this can be circumvented with using different DNS servers. OR Do they block http get requests? I have no knowledge of traffic interception, however; I feel this is the most plausible method.\n\nMy reason for stating the above is because whenever I try to visit a website blocked (or redirected to a block page) by my ISP it is usually a http request. If I add https in the URL the website appears and I have access to it.\n\nFor example: http://websitename.com \u2013 blocked\nhttps://websitename.com \u2013 full access.\n\n",

Fake YouTube links redirect users to phishing pages\u00a0\n\nUsing the Uniform Resource Identifier authority (URI), phishers obfuscate links and place a legitimate resource address, like http://youtube, at the beginning of URLs to deceive users and make the link appear authentic and safe.\u00a0\n\n# 2. \u00a0\u00a0Phishers use fake online shops with surveys to steal credit card information\n\nThe new phishing scheme we named FoxWhoops targets American e-commerce customers with fake sites promising a reward for completing a survey\u00a0\n\nThe attack utilizes a system of checks. Users who fail them are sent to a Fox News RSS page or a page with a \u2018Whoops!\u2019 image. Those who pass the checks are offered to enter their bank card info to purchase the \u2018reward\u2019 at a discount.\n\n# 3.  \u00a0A SystemBC client is targeting Linux-based platforms\n\nThe\u00a0Linux\u00a0version of\u00a0SystemBC\u00a0proxy implant is potentially designed for internal corporate services. It is commonly used to target corporate networks, cloud servers, and even IoT devices.\u00a0\n\nThis\u00a0Remote Access Trojan\u00a0is designed to maintain encrypted communication with C2 servers, using the same custom protocol, ensuring connection to a unified infrastructure of both Windows and Linux implants.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nA proxy implant within a victim\u2019s infrastructure is a crucial tool for attackers, allowing for lateral movement and pivoting without deploying additional detectable tools, further evading detection on the host.\u00a0\n\nThis version is more stealthy and far more dangerous. Samples do not have clear family detection by security vendors.\u00a0",

        "body": "I figure this is the best place to post this. But the TLDR is Linkedin has been hacked, and someone what appears to be from China is basically using a backdoor system to change people's passwords, 2fa, turning off passkeys, and adding their email to an account. This basically allowing them to automate an attack to gain access to accounts, and use them for whatever means they want to.\n\nMine they tried to scam a few people.\n\n# What happened?\n\nAbout 2AM EST I gotten 2 emails.\n\nThe first was a \"You've successfully changed your LinkedIn password.\"\n\nThe next was \"The email address \\_ was recently added to your LinkedIn account.\" I'm not sure if it is allowed for me to share the email. But it's obviously a bot email. It was basically a whatever with a bunch of numbers @ hotmail. I searched it and it didn't come up on anything.\n\nI was on my phone at the time and tried to log in directly through Linkedin. The password didn't work. I went to my computer, and it looks like they took down my passkey. Like the profile wasn't marked with it being used when I tried to log in.\n\nAnyways the following happened.\n\n* I tried to reset the password\n* I got an email for a pin. Note when the hacker did it, I never got this.\n* I put in the pin.\n* It then asked me to put in a code it sent to a phone number. The ending numbers proved they changed the 2FA to their number.\n* I also got a email saying someone trying to access the account and to put in the code from phone number that ended with xx to complete it. When the hacker did this, I never got this.\n\nThis indicated to me that likely this was a backend deal. Note my password was randomly generated, I had 2FA, and so on.\n\nI did some research and found others on Linkedin reddit page was experiencing the same thing over the past month or so. Many also say they had 2FA and so on the hacker bypassed.\n\nAfter I reported it directly to Linkedin. It looks like many others have also reported it. Any case you can look up on google\n\nLinkedin compromised account\n\nUnder the first option with their site you should see \"Reporting Account Access Issue\", click on that and fill that out. They will want you to prove your identity.\n\nAt about 3am I stopped trying and figure I can see what damage was done when I get back end, and maybe close down the account since I didn't really use Linkedin anyways.\n\n# Getting back in\n\nAt 7:50PM EST I got an email from Linkedin that was basically a copy and paste saying I was back in. It basically ignored what I wrote about their back end was hacked.\n\nSeveral times between then and 8:42 PM I did get a notification for a pin. This is when the hacker/bots was trying to get back in.\n\n8:42 PM I seen the email and got back in.\n\n# Damage\n\nThe hacker changed my profile icon, name, changed my thing to (She/Her), and did some backend stuff that was reset when Linkedin did their part. Their email was taken off\n\nTheir phone number however wasn't taken off. I am not sure about the rules on sharing such things on here.\n\nThe icon and name was of a Japanese girl. Tinyeye didn't find any match. But looking closer at the image it was AI generated. I'm not sure if it is allowed to share. From an icon it was hard to see but blowing it up, the eyes are odd and the AI messed up the ear and physics.\n\nI'm 99% sure the name is also AI generated. Searching for the name it looks like other Linkedin profiles was hit with this same exact thing, and some even have the same image. The name is \"Lissy Suzuki\"\n\nThey contacted a few people. I think recruiters or other scammers. They started their message with\n\n\"Hi \\_User\\_\n\nIt's great to connect with you, how's your day going?\"\n\nBased on how it writes I'm also 99% sure the hackers are using an AI to write it.\n\nAfter a few messages they try to get the person to move the conversation to What's App. After that the conversations basically end when the person agrees to move the conversation to What's App.\n\nOddly they targeted people in Geophysics and Geomechanics more than anything else. I don't know if there is a deeper meaning or it was just working down a list.\n\nNote the hacker didn't change anything else on the profile itself. Meaning all my certs with my name are there, the description, and so on are still there. So it would take someone a second of looking at the profile to easily find it was a hacked account.\n\n# My next actions\n\nI will be taking down my profile. I mostly kept my profile as a quick thing for my resume. So I can see what dates I did whatever event, degree, etc. But this is one of those, if you aren't using it then you might as well take it down.\n\n# Why I think it was the backend of Linkedin being hacked that caused this and not on my side?\n\nAs mention, I notification for any pin or anything until the password was reset, and they added their email. Where when I tried I did get an email for each thing. Basically they bypassed everything.\n\nIf it wasn't for those 2 emails, I wouldn't of known anything was happening.\n\nOn top of this, as mention above. Many others for the past month or so on their reddit page has been reporting this exact thing. This all indicating a breech that Linkedin simply isn't telling anyone about, and it's unknown what damage is truly done.\n\nIt's hard to say what Linkedin should do since if they request a password reset. The hacker maybe treated as the legit owner of the account.\n\nIn fact, I would like to say others should do x. But because everything indicates the hackers had backend access of Linkedin to reset passwords and change given things of a profile before doing so. I am not sure what someone can do other than what they are already likely doing. IMO this is 100% on Linkedin.",

I believed him but was a little confused about why he had me change my routing and account number. He gave me different bank account numbers and told me the money would still go to my bank account. I contacted DoorDash this morning and they informed me that dash does not call drivers unless it\u2019s a response to a dispute or safety issues. \n\nThe CRAZY thing is the guy was sending codes that I had to enter to verify it was me. He was also able to remove the active location I was headed to for the (imaginary) customer. \nHe knew my customer rating, acceptance, and completion rate as well. \nNot sure how he did it but these scammers are getting pretty good. SCARY\n\nThe lady I talk with from dash said she was going to inform all the service reps, but we all know how that works!! \n\nEVERYONE, be on the lookout for this scam!!!

Job is fairly low stress at the moment (I\u2019m new), is not a SCIF (I worked in a SCIF the last 7 years), and I have the ability to work from home when necessary (use not abuse type deal), but it is in the healthcare industry and the CyberSec team is geographically separated. Drive to work is \\~9 miles and 15-25 mins with traffic which is nice.\n\nMy experience comes from Cyber Security the last 7 years in the military with certs ranging from CISSP, GCIH, CASP, CCNA, etc. I also have my BS in CS&IA. My frustration with the current position is my lack of visibility from an actual cyber security perspective. I can look at the security features built into the NGFW appliances but that\u2019s about it. I feel like I am seeking more of a CyberSec role based on my previous experience and hard work to get to this point. I also do feel, while not currently doing much at this job since I am still new, underpaid for my experience. \n\nI now have an offer for 138k from a defense contractor as a Cyber Security Engineer. This is also a hybrid position (2 days \u2013 Tues/Wed).  This would be SCIF work again and an extra commute of \\~45 mins \u2013 1 HR (worst case-scenario) added to my already daily commute. I already have my TS/SCI so the clearance part wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but I am wondering if it is worth the jump in salary to move for 20k more with that added commute and back into a SCIF. \n\nAny input is appreciated as for some reason I am torn on this decision.

The transactions are relatively small, like typically <$100 or so a month.  \nParanoid me also worries that if someone did break into this dorks' account I could end up implicated / having to deal with investigation, etc.\n\nNow here's the Kafkaesque part: I actually took time out of my own day on a couple of occasions to try to notify \\*someone\\* about this obvious security issue, and even though I clearly explain what has happened they want my CC number which I don't have and then ask me for my SSN # which is irrelevant and I absolutely won't give them. I try to explain over and over that it isn't my account but somehow it doesn't seem to get through to their scripted brains.\n\nThis is so frustrating that I've even considered and immediately dismissed the idea of requesting a new password to try to figure out who this is, but obviously that would be a TERRIBLE idea.\n\nI can't find any contact info for fraud reports that aren't related to my own accounts. I'd say fuck it, add it to my spam filter, and let this idiot keep doing his/her idiot thing, but again have that nagging worry that this might somehow be connected to my identity.\n\nTo add to complication I live in Canada, not US.

This resulted in most SMTP implementations to just fall back to plain-text if the TLS handshake fails. This does make the problem worse, since you'll never notice your certificate has expired, because email is still being delivered.\n\nAdd-ons like [MTA-STS](https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/mta-sts) and [DANE (TLSA)](https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/dane) aim at preventing this downgrade attack by mandating TLS. Basically this indicates to the sender that the server does in fact support TLS, and that the sender should never fall back to plain text. However, this is still 'opportunistic' security, as the sender must support MTA-STS and/or DANE.\n\nYou can harden your email, but email is not, and will never be a truly secure communication standard. Companies that claim otherwise or either naive, lying, or attempting to replace email with some other system (so it isn't email).",

Tried moving to recycling bin, won't allow me. \n\nChecked file properties, had me and another desktop show up on the list with full permissions to my system. I've disabled all permissions, but the file still remains. Thoughts?",

        "body": "I currently work in cybersecurity/information security at a public higher ed institute. I have been approached twice by a former boss about working for a startup as a product owner. The first time I declined it because I just started my first role in infosec, but this time around I\u2019ve been considering it since I\u2019ve had some time in this role. At my current job there\u2019s a lot of systemic issues and problems that really limit the capabilities of my team to address security issues, but the team is full of good people. In addition, it really feels like I\u2019m not being fulfilled in my job, but I do think that\u2019s because I don\u2019t believe the work I do is not impactful in a meaningful way. This is how I\u2019ve felt throughout the various IT roles I\u2019ve been in at this institution though so it isn\u2019t just the cybersecurity role I am currently in. \n\nWith that all being said the startup product owner seems to be more exciting and impactful. In addition I\u2019m being presented with an opportunity to make at least 40k more (1.6x more than current job) at a startup. I\u2019m currently underpaid compared to private companies because I\u2019m working in higher ed and they generally don\u2019t have similar funding for this sort of work. However, my concern is that I\u2019m downgrading my position by going to a product owner role. I know cybersecurity is a fairly coveted field and is difficult to get into so I am lucky to get where I am and if I leave and dislike the product owner role it\u2019ll be difficult to get back in. I do fairly well in my current role and am slated to get a promotion within the next two years.  I\u2019m worried that I may also lower my earning potential and ease of moving around different companies by going into a product owner role vs sticking with cybersecurity.\n\nWould it be a bad idea to go into the product owner role or would it be better to stay with the cybersecurity role and eventually move out of the organization? \n\nAny advice provided is appreciated!

Wheras an attacker may have previously just had to sweet talk a help desk member who probably didn't know the requestor, now the attacker has to sweet talk the users manager, or gather information on the user to guess what their secret questions might be, both of which are harder.\n\nThis does also make remote drive recovery more complicated though and it would be worth warning users about this process in advance and reminding them to, say, keep their managers contact details stored somewhere safe so that they can still request the authorisation email in the event of loss of access to their primary devices.

There are certainly times when there are emails that have the disclaimer of 'Internal Use Only' or 'Confidential - Attorney-Client Privilege' or something of the like. \n\nI'm curious if the interpretation of this policy requires every single piece of data has to have a physical label on it or are there interpretations or assumptions that certain data is 'confidential' or 'internal' or 'confidential?' \n\nHR records are 'confidential' .. General Counsel maintain litigation records are 'confidential' .. Accounting records (bank statements, General Ledger, taxes, and other financial documents) range from 'internal' to 'confidential' depending on interpretation. \n\nFor the Accounting example, would every single bank statement need to have a 'Confidential' stamp put on it? Otherwise, in an audit, how does one prove that the treatment of data is being held to the standards defined by the policy other than to demonstrate, for example, that appropriate access controls are in place and that HR can't see the bank account statements and the A/P clerk can't see employee records?",

I have heard of people being able to tag data or repositories in Azure. What I would want to see, besides the policy, is that you have a data inventory, and it is labeled with the above info. Do you know where your sensitive data is, and what types of protections are around it based on that data label. I think physically labeling the data isn't absolutely necessary. It also depends how intermingled your data is, but imo, if sensitive data is in a folder with non-sensitive data, its all sensitive.\n\nIn your example of HR records being \"confidential\" that wouldn't be enough. The HR system, where HR records are stored is sensitive. I would want to see an inventory of each system with a breakdown, not a breakdown by function or department.",

App updates are often staggered, so not to flood backend systems with post-patch app re-initialization traffic.\n\n\\- If you are a web developer you are probably publishing multiple releases to your site in a single day.

This obviously doesn't scale when hundreds of SSO applications I now have to monitor.\n\nAnyone have a SaaS supported account review product they are happy using in their review process?",

In fact, to go to an NSA certified cyber security program you will have to learn C.  Here are some books I recommend:\n\n* Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson\n* Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig\n* The Cert C Secure Coding Standard by Robert C.

Seacord\n* Software Testing and Quality Assurance: Theory and Practice\n\nIf you don't know C, I recommend A Book on C by Al Kelley and Ira PohlApplication security\n\nThe last book is about quality assurance, but it will teach you basic tools of how to test software and what can break software. I taught security and I used the last book.\n\nAlso, static analysis only gets you so far.  Here are some things you should be able to answer and understand why they have issues: Given the following code snippets, what bugs can be introduced using them:\n\n`fp=open (\"file.txt\",\"w\");`\n\n`rename(\"file1.txt,\"file2.txt\");`These need to be considered together:\n\n`int array[]=(8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0)`\n\n`i=9;`\n\n`array[i++]=0;`\n\n`array[++i]=0;`You don't have to answer here, just know why they are problems because they are quite common issues.",

        "body": "Hi, last week I got an email from a company that offer online loan services saying that my loan has been approved. But I get such spam emails all the time, so I was about to ignore it but I noticed that the way this email was written was a little different. So I got curious and looked at the domain and it was from a legitimate company. So I searched my email inbox and saw that they had send me a code to confirm my email and somehow the hacker got that information as well. I called that online company, filed the police report, and pretty much followed every step that is listed in that famous Reddit post that lists what to do if your identify is ever stolen. \n\nBut I am still confused as to how they got access to the code that was sent to my Gmail for verification. I have a 2 factor verification on my Gmail and it wasn't logged on from anywhere else and i also changed my password 3 months ago (out of habit) and changed my password right away after this incident. \n\nAnyone know if I missing anything here?\n\nThanks",

Burning STL files onto a CD and using that with an external USB CD/DVD drive then pitching the CD.\n\n2. Using an SD card, with the write switch in read only mode (I believe that this isn\u2019t failsafe and is a software-only lock, like a \u201chey don\u2019t write to me\u201d flag).

Anything \u2018interesting \u2018 generates an alert that gets reviewed by SOC analysts.  False positives are weeded out, and rules are adjusted.  Verified alerts are triaged, with significant findings being passed on to incident handlers and/or engineers depending on the nature of the finding in the form of tickets.  All tickets are reviewed each two week sprint, and alerts are reviewed periodically to verify the performance of the various teams involved.\nThings can and do still get missed - but reasonable due diligence is met, we are compliant, and we have security controls in place that align with our risk tolerance.",

However you tie that XSS alert to a FireEye or AV alert, now it has value and is actionable.

Sec plus would be a good next cert or if you feel like you want to take the GIAC exams they are well respected. CompTIA also has a CASP which is a bit more difficult and should be after the sec plus. The main factor here as well is application and cost.  CompTIA is much more affordable and GIAC classes are pricy. It depends what kind of hi on you are trying to end up with at the end of the day.  All those things can get you familiar with security concepts, controls, frameworks, mechanisms, etc but further toward pen testing infosec side not so much. It depends on what you want to do in IT security.   Udemy has some cheap courses to start or cybrary as well. I think there is a course on udemy that might help you find out what direction you may want.  Good luck. ",

Being that the grass always seems greener on the other side I am wondering if it actually is. I would like to get the real story from people who actually work in Information Security.\n\nMy questions (to those who actually work in the field) are these.\nHow would you rate your overall job satisfaction?\nHow much do you typically work in a week?\nWhat do you actually do day to day?\nWhat is your pay/salary like (use ballpark numbers if you are uncomfortable divulging specifics)?\nAre industry certificates worth anything in the real world?\nWhat sort of education would be necessary to break into Information Security?\nWould you recommend getting into the field?",

                "body": "I think your mileage will vary depending on where you land, and what type of work within infosec you want to pursue.\n\nThat said, I'm currently a secops engineer (I've also done compliance, and some development work), and while I am very thankful for my job, I'm not super satisfied with my job most days. I'm about 50/50 I guess. There are definitely times that work is fun and engaging, but other times it feels like a drag, especially when bureaucracy / politics get in the way of doing what's right.\n\nTo answer the rest of your questions, I typically work 40 hours a week (thankful for my management on that one) unless I'm on-call that weekend. What I do day to day varies. Work on vuln scans (keeping the tools up to date, building automation to simplify tasks, work on reports and tickets), security architecture reviews, access request reviews (mostly firewall stuff but also account requests), incident response, web application firewall management, building automation for tasks within my team, etc. I'm in the mid 130k's salary wise, in the seattle area. Certs definitely help - my previous job increased your salary by $5K/year once you obtained your CISSP, and another $5K if you obtained the PMP. My current management doesn't really care about certs if you know your stuff, so YMMV. They do like their guys pursuing certs, I just never hear them talk about a candidate's certs during interviews.\n\nCan't really speak to education. Most of the folks I've worked with in the past 5 years were not infosec people originally. I've worked with really talented infosec folks with no degree (tech background though), as well as people with biology, political science, and archeology degrees. It's been interesting to see, for sure, and gives me hope that maybe my kids won't have to go to college in order to break into infosec, if that's what they want to do.\n\nI would recommend getting into the field, as long as you pursue something that's interesting to you. Some people really like the compliance, risk, privacy side of the house (lots of management-type work, documentation, etc.), others really like penetration testing, others really like threat hunting, log analysis looking for malice, security tool management, etc. There's never a shortage of work, and you'll always have to keep learning about new (and old) technologies.\n\nThere are definite perks to infosec, such as job security (there's a high demand for infosec professionals) and good pay (YMMV). As a family man, these two are huge pluses for me.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps somewhat. Sorry for the bad formatting - just wanted to post as quickly as possible.

We have no idea with what purpose.\nThere are some site folders with 755 chmod.\nAnd also there are some inconspicuous files with completely unsuspected names (search.php, inc.php, etc).\n(Important: some files have backdating timestamp and usually saved with 600 chmod in public_html).\n\nIn several projects with Yi2 malware was unable to pass through the public_html due to lack of suitable folders.\nSo, it's clear that malware is trying to find any folder with 755 chmod and then upload into this folder.\nBut how? Via FTP? Nope. We checked our logs - no one except developers didn't log in, there's only our update log.\nPeaks of the load fell on 4, 16, 18 of September.\n\nIt could be botnet and for sure favicon_12d923(attached) - start-file.\nBut how could they access the server?\nWhat means of prevention besides the correct chmod and passwords changing on FTP would you suggest? (providing that we are using shared server and have no config permissions)\n\nSo, attaching files in hope that someone will be interested in decoding this malware.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0By9z-2aT_AUzaElDbUZmMmx2ckU/view?usp=sharing ",

The coursework doesn't include any kind of built-in industry certifications (CompTIA A+, CCNA, CompTIA Security+, etc.) All my coursework is done on VMs using (mostly) Windows and Linux; mostly Ubuntu (some Kali/Debian but very minimal) but using school servers.\n\nI really enjoy scripting but when I'm scripting I feel like I'm constantly googling things and it feels like \"cheating\" to me. I learn best through repetition, so I keep telling myself \"you'll get better once you get into the field\" but I'm TERRIFIED that I'm going to show up for my internship/first job and they're gonna realize I don't know wtf I'm doing. My IT friends and instructors are all reassuring, but they're people I know IRL, so I'm paranoid they're just \"softening the blow\".\n\nWhat did your starting journey in your field look like? Do you have any suggestions for youtube channels or other sites/services I could look at to get some additional \"practice\"? Should I be studying/trying for the certifications in addition to my degrees?",

These reports focus on five key areas: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. Typically, the report includes:\n\n* **System Description**: This gives an overview of the services covered by the audit.\n* **Control Activities**: This outlines the security measures and controls your company has in place to meet the trust criteria.\n* **Auditor\u2019s Opinion**: The auditor will either issue a **Type 1** report (assessing whether the controls are well-designed) or a **Type 2** report (evaluating how effectively those controls are working over time).\n\nTo interpret the report, pay close attention to the **auditor's opinion**. If there are any **exceptions or issues**, they\u2019ll be highlighted, which could indicate areas for improvement.\n\nWhen clients or vendors request your SOC 2 report, it\u2019s often to ensure your security practices align with their standards. It\u2019s best to have the most recent **SOC 2 Type 2** report available, and be ready to address any exceptions or findings. Sharing it securely (via a portal, for example) is also important.\n\nHopefully that helps clear up some of your questions! Let me know if you need any more info. \ud83d\ude0a",

All reports will include Security.  The others are optional based on your service offering and the expectations of your clients.  Understanding what TSCs are included in the report is a good starting point.\n\nIf you are scrutinizing someone else's report, read the audit carefully.  Look for exceptions.

        "body": "Sality is a highly sophisticated malware known for infecting executable files and rapidly spreading across networks. It primarily creates a P2P botnet that is used for malicious activities such as spamming, data theft, and downloading additional malware.\u00a0\n\nTo see how Sality operates, check out\u00a0[its sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/88fc3d03-71f6-48e7-b9d3-a76217d04c87?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=sality&utm_content=linktoservice&utm_term=090924).\n\n1. **Execution Process:**\u00a0Upon execution, Sality decrypts and runs a secondary code segment (loader) in a separate thread within the infected process, responsible for launching the main payload.\n2. **Security Evasion:**\u00a0Sality targets security software by terminating antivirus processes and deleting critical files. It may also modify system settings to reduce security levels and block the execution of security tools.\n3. **Data Theft and Spam:**\u00a0Capable of stealing sensitive information like cached passwords and keystrokes and searching for email addresses to send spam.\n4. **C2 Communication:**\u00a0Communicates with C2 servers, often via a P2P network, to download additional payloads or updates.\n5. **Botnet Formation:**\u00a0Modern variants can form botnets, allowing attackers to control multiple machines for DDoS attacks and further malware propagation.\n\nHave you encountered Sality or similar malware in your experience? How did you handle it?",

Or you could make it so everyone has to fix a vulnerability that someone else found. IE, if one of them was able to social engineer protected information from customer service, then they could help construct an educational system (pamphlets, online courses, etc) for that department to be more informed on these types of attacks.

Due to AI being used by a lot of third parties in the development process, new compliance/privacy related risks are stemming. For eg, the Data used during the training of model (and some of them actually do it continually with our prompts, leading to loss of privacy/IP), risks arising from unsupervised use, etc. \n\nI wanted to know if there is any framework that exist to check about these issues, (NIST has recently released one, called the AI Risk Management Framework : [https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) ). I am looking for a framework that acknowledges different control categories that might be affected, and thus poses some questions to assess the same. \n\nPlease help me out, and do let me know if there are any questions, I will promptly answer them (Pls be patient too as I am just 21 yo and would really love if I learn something from this conversation\ud83d\ude0a)",

It's not mine and is oddly missing functionality such as the ability to reset it. This is important because as at the current moment:\n\n\\- I cannot log into said router to tinker around with settings to my benefit (obviously being mindful of other's privacy and access). \n\n\\- VPN connections suddenly stop. All of a sudden I am internet nude\n\n\\- VPN searches return with \"Error\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\".\n\n\\- Todat Google search mozilla returned the below as top result (included the dev tools picture because these dodgy sites always seem to have 00s of warnings and errors). Correct me if I'm wrong but Mozilla is a non-profit and so should have a .org followed by the domain name. I got this instead:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[source: google search on my device](https://preview.redd.it/k1i067o3vhtc1.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2906127c050653a71c3ab980fc7ad6ae855e099)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig.2: Dodgy firefox](https://preview.redd.it/4mun4uon0itc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=629877db40903fa138bac329a2b81c769efa72c7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig 3: Legit firefox](https://preview.redd.it/ixshu2kx0itc1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=918367da505b68b3ac2de867d8840dd3e49a578e)\n\nThese are certificates which a closer look reveals to be riddled with warnings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig 4: I'm not a website developer, but this looks less dodgy than figures 1 and 2](https://preview.redd.it/nfinvu511itc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=412ec8f99af9bfb5ed13d3847fffb762b1c78159)\n\n[Figure 5: Should be able to look up the issuer?

I randomly get Apple showing up too from my iPhone.](https://preview.redd.it/jyo9urv5xhtc1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef0a293e07ad905b07790b87460d2ed4ccd4147)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[One of the certificates in closer detail.](https://preview.redd.it/vcnbvmucxhtc1.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebcb68dcdd456c5591ea110ba52577530d2ae57e)\n\nI've tried video captures of my screen for logging purposes. Initially this was working ok until I noticed they were randomly stopping with the videos disappearing/or being saved in inconvenient locations. Duplicate storage is now rife too. That is, my set up to automatically sync with OneDrive is no longer working and almost impossible to resolve (given that at any step I am reminded of 00s of other red flags such as unexpected device slowdowns/network issues/files difficult or impossible to find. \n\nI feel as though I might be under cyber attack with the attackers attempting to prevent any sort of coherent evidence logging to present to police. I've noticed search suggestions indicative of a certain known group of people who would actually do this kind of thing out of hate crime - plus probably recruiting willing participants along the way. I've been subject to low level psychological harassment but always just under the radar of being able to name culprits or too close to home for me to want to admit/accept/report/investigate further or be intrusive.\n\nTrying to stay open minded but just have that gut feeling thing's aren't quite right. Some of these might turn out safe, but with drivers installed from [Devgru.co.kr](https://Devgru.co.kr), which seems redirects to a Korean military and communications equipment exports site, I'd prefer a few more false positives to a nasty false negative.  \n\nLet me know what you think, or if there is any further information which might shed light on what is happening? \n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

The Apps have to be recertified annually by the Business Owner for the App. (If the Business owner leaves, then the App is \"transferred\" to their manager, who can re-assign it. This avoids the orphaned owner problem).\n\nWe have asked the SaaS App providers to periodically (usually monthly) send us the lists of users and their entitlements - this is only for all SaaS Apps that meet certain business criticality criteria. In some cases, the providers can also provide the last logon data (although, we can glean that from the Azure AD logs as well).\n\nWith this data, we can set up recertification rules. For example, for some apps, if a user has not logged in for over 180 days, we can trigger an account disablement request. It always helps if the SaaS provider supports SCIM or a similar protocol.\n\nThese are then reviewed and certified by users as part of the entitlement recertification process.\n\nDuring recertification, the user is provided with a list of applications that they have access to, and the roles that they have been granted. They need to affirmatively recertify that they need access to the critical application, absent which a account disablement request is created.\n\nWe also are able to test to see if the Provider is honoring our requests in a timely manner because we perform reconciliation between App Data and our IGA system.

AFAIK in US you are regulated if you are healthcare, financial organization or federal agency. But I haven't seen any wide US-originated laws which bend over lot's of companies like our law for working with sensitive info about customers, is there any?\n\ntl;dr is there any federal US law, which regulates almost any middle-sized company in an exact way providing exact rules to follow and not being vague like \"i order you to protect your info\"",

                "body": "Disabling SSL/TLS versions will impact any service/app that utilizes it's security function whether it is a webserver or not. Quite often you would secure your backend communications between apps with TLS to mitigate risk of exposing the traffic to anyone that wants to sniff the network that shouldn't be. This is somewhat more important in cloud environments as the cloud service provider themselves can see your traffic at their discretion if you don't encrypt the connection  in some fashion.  Simply, TLS 1.2 solves the plain text connection exposure issue. \n\nTheir concerns could be justified without first investigating what internal services are negotiating on anything other than TLS 1.2. (not vulnerable currently). By default all version are allowed and the negotiations of which to use start at the latest and greatest so an investigation is warranted. It might be as simple as identifying that non of your backend stuff is ever negotiating on those old versions and disabling them will be harmless. The questions or investigation needs to be specific to whether if any of those apps are negotiating with other apps over TLS 1.0/1.1 or SSLv2/v3. If they are, then they should be a task to instead have them negotiate only on TLS 1.2 or higher when able. This should **not** be done iteratively as in just checking one server and then making the change explicit to TLS 1.2 because it could break backend processes (This in reference to the dependencies they are concerned about). Imagine a simple scenario where you have a webserver talking to an app server  talking to a database and they all are currently connected on SSLv2.  You then only make the change on the app server to enforce explicit negotiating on TLS 1.2 without addressing the other 2 (webserver and database), at this point you might have a failed negotiation and thus a secure network connection will not be establish and thus breaking whatever you're running until you revert the change. It is important to map it out and someone needs to have a good idea of what every service is communicating on what version of TLS on. this effort scales with the size of the environment but once mapped out and documented it shouldn't have to be done again unless changes are made without paper trail... then you have more systemic issues that need to be addressed. \n\nThe **only** exception to allow vulnerable, deprecated version of TLS/SSL continue in an environment trying to be secure is because the applications is fairly old and unchanged and doesn't know how to communicate securely on anything other than older versions without some significant refactoring of the code (basically the up-front costs out weighs the risk conclusion which would be signed off by someone who has skin in the game if the environment gets compromised). Otherwise it is typically best practice for enterprise environments to only allow communication on the non-deprecated, non-vulnerable version of TLS 1.2.",

I've had nothing but trouble trying to break into the field for over 5 years with little to no luck. I understand that security jobs want experience, education and certifications. So I'm looking for some guidance or a roadmap on how to get into an entry level SOC analyst position or similar.\n\nI'm sure similar questions have been asked but I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to provide some advice based on my experience and education. \n\nIn my circumstance I have not gone to a traditional college. With my education I received a certificate of achievement in information security management, a cybersecurity diploma, CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Security+ and was a member of the National Technical Honors Society. While in school I started work as a cellphone and computer repair technician. When I finished school I was promoted to store manager and shortly after became a franchise manager for a hands-off owner handling every facet of the business. While working there I became an Apple Certified iOS Technician. I stuggled to get into a more in depth IT job as most companies didn't find my experience fitting. Eventually I reached a cap in salary and experience in that role and transitioned into a Tier 1 service desk position. Coming up on a year and I now find myself in a tier 2 position without the promotion nor title. I've obtained a secure email gateway certification while gaining much more exposure and experience with many types of technology as well.\n\nI'm now studying for the CompTIA Cysa+ in attempt to supplement my experience to get into a security position. Any advise on a roadmap, certifications I should go for, or anything I should focus on would be greatly appreciated. I hope to work my way into a penetration testing career. \ud83d\ude4f",

Otherwise, here's a list of steps I wrote to complete ISO 27001: \n\n  \nHow to get ISO 27001 without getting lucky:\n\nPreparation\n\n- Understand the context and business objectives\n\n- Engage management, get their support\n\n- Buy the official ISO/IEC 27001:2022 document\n\n- Get a course to lead the ISO 27001 implementation (optional)\n\nBuilding the ISMS \n\n- Define your scope\n\n- Define your information security policy\n\n- Adopt a risk management methodology\n\n- Inventory your assets\n\n- Perform a gap analysis against requirements 4-10 and Annex A controls\n\n- Use the gap analysis to feed a risk assessment\n\n- Define risk treatment plans\n\n- Establish an ISMS charter (how is your ISMS designed?)\n\n- Define ISMS roles and competencies\n\n- Schedule internal and external audits\n\n- Define planning objectives and indicators\n\n- Create policies and procedures\n\n- Complete your statement of applicability (SOA)\n\n- Conduct the internal audit\n\n- Update your SOA\n\n- Go through management review\n\n- Address internal audit findings\n\n- Go through the certification audit\n\n- Get certification\n\n- Maintain certification\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Other people can have different approaches and it's fine\n\n- These are general steps, but context wins over general guidance\n\n- Many of these steps can be parallelized\n\n- The importance of having management on board can't be stressed enough\n\n- This list can appear as long. It is, in my opinion, the \"unskippable\" steps to get there. Prefer less \"sexy\" truths over something else. \n\n- For simplicity and practicality reasons, we often reduce ISO in 8 to 12 high-level steps. These views are valid and good reminders of what matters most. \n\n- I just prefer this view to make sure nothing has been forgotten.\n\nBest, Tris",

We can assume they are configured correctly and will forward packets and apply their security policy without interference with the proxy.\n\nThe proxy can be seen as a simple server for the purpose of this, as we once again will not mangle with its proxy configuration, just the routing one. The confusing thing may be that, therefore, there is no connection between the users and the internet but that is actually the goal with a proxy. But explaining that would take quite a while.\n\nYour goal is therefore to create the routing table so the proxy server can connect to both network through the firewalls. So for 0.0.0.0/0, the internet, and 192.168.1.0/24, the users, you need to define the route to reach them with a gateway, the first hop address, and an interface, aka from which address of the proxy you need to send the packet.\n\n*Spoiler ahead*\nFor the users in you exercise, the answer is 192.168.1.0/24 -> Gateway 192.168.2.1, Interface 192.168.2.2 . Because in order to reach the users network, you need to send packets to the bottom firewall, which address on the proxy side is 192.168.2.1, and the interface is just the proxy address on the same link. I will leave to you the part for the internet. Have a fun time networking.",

Information Security ***is*** Information Technology. IA/GRC is the mechanism(s) through which we collect and report KPI on InfoSec/IT. \n2. Any work that may be accomplished manually, may also be automated. If you're going to do something more than once, take the time to automate the process. \n3. Most CISOs I've dealt with were either non-infosec skillsets, or mis-labeled security managers. CISO is a sales job at most companies. Take the time to understand what your CISO is actually trying to accomplish. You'll probably find that he has no idea what he's doing, so he's pissing on the wall hoping for a Picasso to emerge. Using #1 and #2 above, you can help guide him to KPI that will drive business outcomes, and reporting that can be automated.",

Well you first have to know offensive capabilities.\n\nYou can get all of this experience for free, no certifications necessary. Start reading security blogs, watching YouTube videos, etc and practice practice practice! Deep dive into that which you do not understand, chunk by chunk.\n\nWhen it comes time for the interview, they won't expect you to know everything, but at least know what you do know well. Show that you take initiative and drive towards learning security not for the paycheck, but because 'it interest you'.\n\nSo my advice is save your money and start self educating with what's available. \n\nI'm 10+ years deep in security, current role is threat hunting hackers all day and I can tell you the best techniques do not come from formal education, they come from Twitter users, blogs, video conferences and the like.\n\nFurthermore, as a hiring manager what I'm looking for is someone who knows what they do and acknowledges what they don't know. Numerous occasions we would get a candidate who had a cert, but didn't really understand much in depth. We pass on those guys.\n\nOh, and you gotta get to know a scripting language. My advice would be python. Second runner up, powershell. Knowing at least 1 scripting language will help when your looking at an attackers script, or some new exploit that's been released etc. Without this experience you will be lost.\n\nAlright, now to answer your question, SANS GIAC certs are the best and most respected industry. They're also about $8,000 per course. I would recommend starting out with a 500's class like I did, but if you need something more entry level, check out the 400s.",

For certifications, you can look at ISC2 (CAP, CISSP, CCSP) and ISACA (CISA, CRISC, CGEIT, CISM, CCAK).  ISACA would be a good starting point to look at certifications (or just look at the syllabi for each cert to look at what the field entails).\n\nLuckily, for GRC as well as much of cybersecurity, it doesn't require that you know a programming language or are into pentesting.  While certainly, anything helps, it's not a requirement.  Knowing how to program is good if you are doing code reviews or in some pentesting.  Knowing how to script is good for administration tasks, etc.  For GRC, you don't need to know a programming language at all.\n\nAs for the SANS certs, they are the top-of-the-line technical classes.

AWS is the king, but Azure is catching up due to Microsoft's share of the enterprise OS market.

NIST 800-53 is what we audit and pentest against.  In the credit card industry, PCI-DSS, in health HIPAA, and in banking SOX.  In my experience, if there is a lack of a standard in the US, they base it on NIST.  I would recommend looking up the NIST RMF, NIST 800, and if the government, GAGAS, and CIGIE. It's in the ISC2 and ISACA tests more than international standards.  Also, when you're ready to go for a cert, join ISACA as a member.  It's not great, but you get discounted rates on membership, you get access to some CPE classes (important as you need about 30 CPEs a year to maintain your cert) and you get access to their journal. At first, I didn't pay much attention to the journal, but it's actually quite interesting.  The ISC2 and ISACA certs are certs that you only need to pass once. Then you maintain them with CPEs.

If you work in IT, cybersecurity, or have completed a cybersecurity training program at your workplace, your input is especially valuable!\n\nAlso, feel free to share this survey with colleagues or within relevant communities. The more data collected, the better the insights!\n\nThanks in advance for your time\u2014your responses will contribute to a better understanding of how we can combat AI-driven phishing attacks.\n\nIf you have any thoughts or experiences related to AI phishing, feel free to share in the comments!

I would in general agree with all the comments here, that there are no explicit requirements for server rooms in ISO 27001, and definitely metal fire resistant doors are not a requirement of ISO 27001!\n\nHaving said that, it is important to have in mind that server rooms are information processing facilities, and there are a number of controls can be applied to information processing facilities. As always, the choice of inclusion or exclusion of controls should be based on risk assessment, but in general here are some best practices to have (**these are NOT mandatory, just something to consider when doing your risk assessment**):\n\n\\- Access control systems (keycard system) to track entry of personnel to the server room and control access\n\n\\- Fire detection and fire management systems (fire extinguishers) / flood detection\n\n\\- Backup power supplies (UPS, Generator) - depends on the Availability \n\n\\- CCTV\n\n\\- Secure area guidelines (eg no foods, drinks in the server room)\n\n\\- HVAC with optional backup system (auxiliary A/C) and/or monitoring of temperature\n\n\\- Having a physically sound perimeter (no gaps, no dry walls, windows secured, alarm system installed, no water heaters in server rooms)\n\n\\- Not explicitly labeling \"Server room\" for everyone to see - give minimum identification\n\n\\- Secure you cabling so that it is not subject to accidental damage\n\n  \nYou can check ISO 27002 as a guidelines on implementation, but bear in mind that these are NOT requirements, just guidance, and the choice of the controls is based on your risk assessment (eg you are not going to buy a $100k generator for a server room that hosts an application for internal purposes that can tolerate downtimes).

It's making things more efficient and productive but also introducing new challenges as cybercrime gets even more sophisticated. On one hand, AI can process vast amounts of data at lightning speed and detect threats that might take cybersecurity professionals hours to identify. It means organizations can respond to incidents much quicker, potentially saving them from significant data breaches. On the other hand, AI is enabling cybercrime in many ways. For example, AI-powered password-guessing software can guess common seven-digit passwords in minutes. Generative malware allows people without programming skills to create malicious software and tools. AI-powered deepfakes can engage victims with synthetic video and audio that mimics real people. New technologies bring new risks, and remaining vigilant is more important than ever.\u00a0 If any of you are using AI to protect digital data, can you share your experience? And how do you think AI can change cyber safety?\u00a0",

I\u2019ve been researching and I realized there\u2019s a ton of stuff I can do but what are the most important things I should focus on first. I have a pc with 32gb of ram. \nThe end goal is cyber but I know I need to build my skills and experience before I get into that sector. \nThanks. \nI",

This not only threatens sensitive data but can also result in the loss of customer trust and even legal penalties.\n\nTake FTP, for example, which doesn't encrypt data. FTP transmits user credentials in clear text during the login process, making usernames and passwords easily accessible to anyone monitoring network traffic. This creates a significant risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nIn today's digital landscape, businesses must move away from these outdated methods and adopt more secure file transfer solutions to protect their data and maintain trust.

Trust is earned not taken. I have so many \"side conversations\" with board members BEFORE actually formally raising anything so that I know what the objections will be ahead of time. I have normally also discussed the financials with the CFO ahead of time to see if what I am going to suggest is even in the realm of financial reality (i.e. asking for $1m capex when your annual revenue is $50k, and credit line maxes out is stupid). This makes the board meeting a formality and not a surprise in most cases. Sure, things come up you weren't expecting but the best advice I received was to admit when you do not know the answer (don't make it up on the spot), rather advise that you do not have that information to hand but you understand the question and will get an answer by X date.\n\nBeing able to sell is as much about talking Board language as it is being a sales-person. As a CISO my role is to ultimately inform and manage risk within the organisations risk tolerance. As such 99% of of what I request funding for is to address risk in one way or another. Consider the following (paraphrasing);\n\n\"We have identified that our Server Hardening controls are not being applied consistently which represents a High Risk as these are public-facing systems containing customer and financial data. Many of these controls are required by a regulator that, if a breach occurred as a result of said control failure, could result in fines of up to $5m. In addition, if a compromise occurred, we would lose our Compliance certification which is currently a contractual requirement for X number of customers representing an ARR loss of potentially $35m. My team have developed a plan to prevent this from occurring which we expect will cost $1m in capital expenditure and ongoing costs of $100k. I have discussed these costs with the CFO who is in agreement that we have sufficient funding to cover them. I recommend that the Board approve this expenditure.\"\n\nYour CEO should garner from the above \"spend $1.5m to reduce the likelihood of the loss of $40m\" to which the answer is normally \"sounds good\".\n\nMy final suggestion is to ensure you are aligning with the business strategy. Unless you are an MSSP, your company is not in the business of InfoSec - you are an overhead and a cost-centre. One of the first things I write in any new business is a high-level Information Security Strategy and have the Board review and approve it. It outlines my understanding of the business strategy, the risks and blockers to that business strategy (as it relates to InfoSec) and sometimes a high-level plan of key initiatives that I plan to do. Consider the following overly simplistic example for a company selling widgets online.\n\n\"Company X is in the business of selling widgets online. As an eCommerce business, we are regulated by PCI-DSS, Law X, Regulator Y etc etc. The Cyber risks we can expect are Cybercriminals who seek Financial gain, \"script kiddies\" who look to gain knowledge and notoriety etc etc. I intend to adopt Cyber Framework X which facilitates a comprehensive framework for establishing Cyber Management. The key initiatives will be A, B, C, D. Over the next 3 - 5 years we will likely need to invest in the Information Security program in order to ensure continued compliance with regulators and reduce risks that could prevent the business from succeeding.\"\n\nGood Luck.",

The transformers are executed one by one - this helps you create complex transformation pipelines. For instance depending on value chosen in the previous transformer, you can decide to execute the next transformer or not.\n\n\ud83c\udd95 **Transformation inheritance** \\- If you have partitioned tables or want to apply a transformation to a primary key and propagate it to all tables referencing that column, you can do so with Greenmask.\n\nThis release also includes several bug\ud83e\udeb2 fixes and improvements\ud83d\udcca.

Searching reddit / online I was concerned to see that there is a hands-on lab component.\n\n\nhttps://www.isaca.org/-/media/files/isacadp/project/isaca/certification/exam-candidate-guides/certificate-program-exam-guide-v1.pdf\n\nCan anyone confirm/deny this ?\n\nSee also : https://old.reddit.com/r/isaca/comments/1943lzr/cybersecurity_fundamentals_certification_exam/\n\nI have some limited experience with using shells/terminals... but I think the $160USD that ISACA asks for the lab course, whilst not actually telling you anything, is really just unfair, the moneygrubbing bastards.\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

            {
                "body": "Some suggestions:\n\n1. Determine compliance requirements. Do you have to comply with PCI-DSS? HIPAA? SOX? That\u2019s your initial list of controls that need to be in place.\n\n2. Select a framework (you\u2019ve chosen NIST - cool, but keep in mind, both SOX and PCI have controls that can be in conflict with NIST, so when in doubt, defer to the compliance standard you\u2019re going to be audited on).\n\n3. Inventory of applications/resources that are in scope for assessment. You need to know what apps or systems you\u2019ll be looking at in order to complete the next steps\u2026because while some risks are consistent with any app (AAA, IAM, etc.), some risks can be unique to a particular application. This is also the step where you should determine application owners, which will dictate control owners when you perform the assessment later.\n\n4. Document a list of risks you aim to assess based on the standards that apply to your org, and build on it. Brainstorm a list of risks for the business (password controls, admin rights to the domain or apps, remote access, etc). This won\u2019t be exhaustive either - just something to start with. Some risks can be unique to a line of business or application, so this can vary significantly (ex. A web hosting company has a very different set of risks vs a retail org).\n\n5. Perform the initial risk and control assessment. Look for compliance to each standard, take screenshots, take copious notes about each risk, and each control that is in place to mitigate it. Update your risk register (step 4) with each risk you\u2019ve found, and how it has been mitigated. If it hasn\u2019t been mitigated yet, make sure that\u2019s clearly indicated in the risk register.\n\n6. Coordinate a call with application/control owners to address the risks that have been identified. Perform recurring calls as needed until each risk has been mitigated, accepted by leadership in writing, or avoided through deprecation, replacement, repair, or upgrade.\n\n7. Create a Risk Assessment Procedure, and add steps 1-6 above to it.\n\n8. Create a Risk Assessment Policy, and indicate that you will perform risk assessments on a scheduled basis, determined by your compliance needs. This schedule/frequency needs to be clearly indicated in the policy and you cannot deviate from it.\n\n9. For each realm of controls (ex. IAM, AAA, application security, web security, network security, domain administration, cloud administration, server administration, etc.), create a procedure for how you\u2019re going to assess the systems in that realm based on the risk/control documents you built during the initial assessment, and make them all tie back to the risk assessment policy you built in step 8. These don\u2019t have to outline every risk - just create a procedure for how you perform the assessment (schedule a review, prepare list of controls, perform review, mitigate findings).\n\n10. Do it all over again. Seriously. Start with the documents you already have, but start from the beginning with new eyes - now that you\u2019ve seen it through once, you might observe things you didn\u2019t before.\n\n\nSome helpful tips:\n\n- you\u2019re never going to find everything in the first pass.\n\n- auditors are always going to find something you didn\u2019t anticipate.\n\n- there will always be some application, process, or utility that does not meet the standard, and your role is to identify mitigations to make it work despite that.\n\n- your documentation needs to be clear, concise, and short. Dont formalize anything in a policy/procedure that could change in a year.\n\n- when documenting risks/controls, reference the source - ex. NIST has some thoughts on password length and rotation, so when you document what your standards are or add risks in the register, indicate where to find those standards within the NIST framework. Another example: PCI is broken up into sections, so when you\u2019re assessing your PCI compliance, save evidence with the section number in the file title for quick reference later.\n\n- CYA. Never let an app owner say \u201cdon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d If they try to, document it anyway, and send it to them to confirm or address. Don\u2019t let it fall on you when an auditor says the control isn\u2019t up to par when you know you had already discussed it with an app owner.",

We added our compliance requirements from PCI and SOX, so then we had a list of controls we needed to assess for - a baseline.\n\nWe then looked at our inventory of apps and built a list of which controls apply to each app. For example: our HRIS is in scope for SOX, so we added a list of the relevant SOX controls that apply to that system.\n\nWe then started working our way down the list of apps, performing initial assessments. During the first assessment, you\u2019re largely getting acquainted with the apps and the owners, while also addressing the basic controls.\n\nOnce we\u2019d completed an initial assessment, we reviewed internally within our compliance team. Did we forget to ask anything? Do we need more details on a specific process or control? What else could an auditor find that we didn\u2019t?\n\nWith this new list of controls and questions, we audited our apps again. We dug deeper into how automation processes work, how reporting structures within apps work, how we documented the integrity of reporting we\u2019d received, and which mitigations might be deemed insufficient. We looked at documentation from the app owners - if it existed - to determine if they were kept up to date and consistently applied. We took note of exceptions - some apps might not have appropriate reporting functionality, or might have a cumbersome IAM process - and documented them as best we could while looking for avenues to mitigate the risk these exceptions represented.\n\nThen we reviewed again. Then we audited again.\n\nNow, we do this quarterly. The first two years were rough - lots of back and forth and discovery of new issues - but eventually we found our footing, and the quarterly & annual reviews go pretty smooth now. Auditors still find chinks in the armor, but it is getting rare, and the findings are more and more obscure.\n\nKeep in mind that my focus is on technical resources, not the financial compliance side of SOX/PCI. That said, what I\u2019ve documented here applies on that side of the house in many ways as well. If your role encompasses both the technical and business controls, then give the same framework an initial shot in both sides and tune accordingly.",

I am aware that I am only as strong as my weakest link [method] for MFA). As opposed to keeping your software TOTP for entries separate using one of the major authn apps, i.e., Google, Microsoft, Bitwarden (standalone app). \n\nI am well aware of the convenience vs security balancing act--no need to preach to the choir. \n\nI am also aware that each PW manager is built differently. If you must, feel free to use a particular offering in your comment. \n\nIn know at the enterprise level, secrets vault platforms already have the TOTP feature built-in. ",

They use this to get onto a blank \u201clanding server\u201d where they then RDP to their respective servers using their own credentials.\n\nMy question is more two fold:\n1) is something like this possible to do, I.e are there MFA suppliers that can generate OTP On a website\n2) how safe in reality would it be?\n\nThanks ",

I would start by auditing account usage by checking logins, system accesses or recent changes and take a cautious for accounts that have had recent activities. Next thing that I would do is to communicate and collaborate with other apartments like IT, HR and other because they can always help in identifying which employees or teams might be tied to specific accounts and then you can cross-reference it. Maybe before disabling any user, you can put that user into the \"restricted\" mode, such as removing access to sensitive systems but leaving non-essential permissions. Most important thing is the communication. Communicate with the team that this will happen and if no one raises concerns after a set period, maybe you can consider disabling them. And the last thing that I would recommend is to document everything. As you will do this, keep detailed notes / records of what steps you have taken and the status of each account. This will help in case you need to explain your actions to management for example. I think that this will help you safely handle accounts without putting your job at risk. All in all, good luck.",

        "body": "Hi everyone,   \nI have a question for you.\n\nMany people has recommended using a password manager other than Chrome.\n\nIf you are using an offline password manager, it make sense that it would be more secure because the attacker needs to hack your computer AND your password manager.\n\nBut if you are using something like BitWarden, which has an online extension, and the data is stored on a server, I just don't understand why is it safer?\n\nWhy should you count on it?\n\n  \n",

You need to enter a password to unlock it every time it starts up (not true for Chrome), which means that if someone steals your vault/database/whatever your particular password manager calls it, they still need your master password to open it.  They would need a specialized, invasive attack on the running, unlocked password manager in memory to achieve the same thing they can do by copying the files from your Chrome profile folder.\n\nAny dedicated password manager will also have a feature to automatically lock after a period of time (customizable, of course).  Chrome does not have this feature, since it never really locks.\n\nIf you are not syncing your Chrome passwords, then a password manager with cloud sync is safer becuase you will not lose access to all of your accounts if your hard drive dies.  If you prefer to trade that Availability for slightly greater Confidentiality, you can simply use a password manager (such as KeepassXC) that does not have automatic cloud sync and keep your own backups.  Just as you can ask Chrome not to sync your saved passwords to the Google cloud.\n\n(If you're willing to spend money, however check out 1Password and its unique extra [secret key](https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/) which prevents an attacker who knows your password from decrypting your vault even if they managed to steal it from the cloud.)\n\nAs more of an exception than the rule: Do not under any circumstances use LastPass.  Their security design is weak (not even encrypting all fields in your vault), they have poor approach to security upgrades (not automatically upgrading the number of scrypt rounds for existing accounts on login), and they have had multiple breaches where user vaults were stolen, followed by (if I recall correctly) a rash of theft from cryptocurrency wallets stored in some of those vaults.\n\nIf you're technically minded, read up on the security architecture of your potential new password manager to learn how different threats are handled.  Here's the [111 page PDF](https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf) documenting the majority of 1Password's technical design that helped give me the confidence to move to their service.",

The 256-bit encryption key is secure enough that it cannot be brute-force attached using today's technology. \n\nThe 256-bit key is derived from your master password using a key derivation function. This usually hashes the master password tens/hundreds of thousands of times, combined with a per-user salt, to get the encryption key. These many rounds of hashing slow down brute-force attacks by several orders of magnitude. As long as you're master password is reasonable long and hard to guess, your password data should be safe.\n\nThe biggest risk is password manager that don't encrypt all of the password data. For example, LastPass was hacked and it was found that the only encrypted the passwords, not the other cleartext data. This causes potential problems for people who use text fields to store their OTA recovery keys.",

The scnv.io page would open when the website link was clicked for a certificate of analysis that SHOULD have came out. \n\nEvery time I clicked on a link that had scnv.io Malwarebytes would flag it as a \u201cphishing\u201d link. So I checked out reported links and Joes Sandbox Cloud has a list of them all labed as HTML droppers and HTML phishing. \n\nSo I decided to try and see where this link goes. \nUsed traceroute to find the IP address to the link. Then used an open source traceroute program that mapped out its trail on a world map. \n\nFirst stop was a Cheney Resevoir in Kansas, which may be connected to Maxmind. Which has already been flagged for unethical data gathering.\n\nThen went to a spot in Cincinnati, Ohio that was a bit close to an Airforce base. \n\nWhat was a bit off putting was the next stops were myself, and then RANDOM spot in London England where the exact address was a small coffee shop off a pier. Google maps had limited photos of the area.\n\nCould be nothing, and I left out certain details cause I have no real clue if this is normal. \n\nDid the company\u2019s website admins know that these links were attached to their links? Is this normal? I have no clue, I\u2019m open to those who know more to help me out. \n\nThanks!\n",

I am using CIS 8 and NIST 800-123 as references.\n\nThe scope includes all applications, infrastructure, and endpoints. My standard does not need to include detailed benchmarks for each application and system, just a general standard and a manual.\n\nI'm unsure how to create a system hardening standard and manual that I can provide to all team managers to help them apply system hardening to their environments.\n\nHas anyone worked on a similar exercise in their organization?

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far and my current plan:\n\n**Current Setup:**\n\n* CVE Data Collection:> Every 24 hours, I run a script to fetch the latest CVEs from cvelistv5. The script cleans, structures the data, and uploads it to Elasticsearch for indexing.\n* Visualization and Alerting:> Using Grafana (switched from Kibana for more flexible visualizations) to create dashboards that display CVE details, severity, affected products, etc.>Grafana also sends email alerts for specific products based on query results.\n\n**Plan to Enhance :**\n\n* Integrate Wazuh :> Use Wazuh for real-time monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities and security threats.> Configure Wazuh to generate alerts based on detected vulnerabilities that match the CVE data.\n* Integrate The Hive :> Set up The Hive to ingest alerts from Wazuh and automatically create incident cases.> Use The Hive for structured incident response, task assignment, and collaboration.\n\n**Example Workflow :**\n\n* Script fetches and indexes CVE data to Elasticsearch.\n* Wazuh monitors systems and detects vulnerabilities, generating alerts.\n* Alerts are sent to The Hive, creating incident cases.\n* Security team uses The Hive to investigate, respond, and resolve incidents.\n* Patching (using tools like Ansible) is initiated if necessary, and progress is tracked in The Hive.\n* Post-incident review and metrics analysis to improve future responses.\n\n**Questions :**\n\n* What do you think of this setup?\n* Have any of you integrated Wazuh and The Hive before? Any tips or best practices?\n* Are there better ways to handle CVE data and automate responses?\n* Any other tools or integrations you\u2019d recommend?\n* How can I integrate patch management into this workflow? ?\n* Thanks in advance for your insights!",

My research specifically investigates how standards like NIS2, ISO27001/2 and 31000 and NIST 181-600 help mitigate third-party risks in the cyber supply chain.\n\nI am looking for professionals in the cybersecurity or compliance fields who would be willing to participate in an interview. Your insights into how these standards are implemented and their impact would be incredibly valuable to my research.\n\n**Details:**\n- The interview would involve only audio recording.\n- It can be conducted via Zoom or Teams, based on your preference and availability.\n- The session is expected to last between 45 to 90 minutes.\n\nYour participation would not only help me complete my thesis but also contribute to a broader understanding of risk management practices in the industry.\n\nIf you're interested in participating or would like more information, please comment below or send me a direct message. I'm looking forward to connecting with you and learning from your experiences!\n\nThank you!",

(That is the reason i can open my mailbox from my phone and pc, and have the exact same mails... the information is not being stored locally on the device, but being pulled from a server.)\n\nAnd if every email is going through a SMTP server, why that server didn't add the \"Recieved\" Field and Value?\n\nI couldn't find any relevant or reliable information so far and i would appreciate your help?\n\nHow can someone send an email without the in between servers to add the \"Received\" Field?",

The CTO and Board are interested in tracking our Risk Posture Metric, but find the FAIR model too complex for our needs.\n\n`Approach Overview:`\n\n1. We plan to structure the Risk Management Implementation Program (RMIP) into five phases, each correlating with a CMMI Maturity Level (1-5).\n2. Develop a questionnaire based on CAN/CIOSC 104:2021 standards and client-specific requirements.\n3. For 25 established controls, assign weighted points where controls scoring above 37.5 points are mandatory, utilizing a basic 4x4 Risk Matrix for weightage.\n4. Implement a Risk Posture Dial to display organizational risk from 0-100%. \n5. Set a Risk Acceptance threshold at 35%, aiming to keep Target Risk below 35% of Posed Risk.\n6. Ongoing Phases: Continuously add and reassess controls, adjusting weightings based on evolving requirements.\n7. Regularly monitor and adjust the Risk Posture Dial to ensure compliance and manage risk exposure as organizational needs change.\n\n  \n(i)Does this strategy seem scalable and suitable for a small organization like ours? (ii) Are there adjustments or considerations we might have overlooked? (iii) What is the best approach you've come across?\n\n  \nThank you for your input!",

It's best to give the site a workbook on what's expected and what you will be looking at/for. This gives time for policies to be updated and no surprises. When the inspection has been completed, give the site a ML score and a 90 remediation period to boost their ML.",

Could anyone explain how it operates behind the scenes? Specifically, I'm curious about who is responsible for publishing and updating CVEs, and whether it provides an API that allows fetching the latest CVEs published every 24 hours.\n\nI've already managed to get the latest CVEs with a simple Python script using the deltaLog.json file  \nin the repo, but I'm wondering if there's a more streamlined API available. I prefer not using the NVD API because the CVE list provides more detailed information about product names, versions, etc.\n\nThanks for your help!",

I\u2019ve only taken a few major specific classes so far since I recently finished all my general ed classes, but they\u2019ve all been statistics and accounting related so I feel like it was all in one ear and out the other. What can I do to not feel like I don\u2019t know anything about info security. What are good ways to learn outside of school. I am doing school online and I think this is a big part of my nerves because I don\u2019t have others to talk with and see if what I\u2019m doing is up to par or if I\u2019m at the level I should be. I\u2019ve always worked with computers and am very confident in my ability but I just don\u2019t think I am learning what I need to yet",

BrowserBruter is now public and available for download, the world's first advanced browser-based automated web application penetration testing tool!\n\nAfter in development for over a year, it is now officially released!\n\n\ud83d\udc49  Proof Of Concept - https://net-square.com/browserbruter/WhyWeNeedBrowserBruter/\n\ud83d\udc49 Live Demonstration -  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1qH_bg_l1aMNDpCYSMXg83o-56vLdPS7&si=LtQxvbLDKWhiCsEC\n\ud83d\udcd6 Explore the documentation:  https://net-square.com/browserbruter/\n\ud83d\udce5 Download now: https://github.com/netsquare/BrowserBruter/releases/tag/v2024.4-BrowserBruter\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 BrowserBruter revolutionizes web application security testing by attacking web applications through controlled browsers, injecting malicious payloads into input fields. It automates the process of sending payloads to web application input fields in the browser and sending them to the server.\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- \ud83d\udd10 Bypass Encrypted HTTP Traffic: Fuzz web application forms even when the HTTP body is encrypted, because it will fuzz web application before encryption takes place.\n- \ud83e\udd16 Bypass Captchas: Allows the pentester to manually perform human interactions to bypass captchas and proceed with payload insertions.\n- \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Fuzz Front-Ends without HTTP Traffic: Can fuzz front-end elements even when there is no HTTP traffic.\n- \ud83d\udd17 Simplified Session Management: Removes the burden of session management, CSRF handling, and other micro-management tasks when using HTTP proxy tools, because these are managed by browser it self which is controlled by Browser Bruter.\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 After fuzzing, BrowserBruter generates a comprehensive report that includes all the data and results of the penetration test, along with HTTP traffic. This report can be viewed using The Report Explorer tool, which comes bundled with BrowserBruter.\n\nHandcrafted in India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Backstory of BrowserBruter\n\n\ud83e\udd77 As a penetration tester working on web application security VAPT projects, I faced a common challenge: the encryption of HTTP traffic was hindering my ability to fuzz input fields using traditional tools.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Available tools like BurpSuite, SQLMap, etc. operate by modifying HTTP requests and responses. However, when encryption is implemented (not ssl, when the http request body's data is encrypted), the HTTP traffic becomes opaque to these tools, making it impossible to inject payloads into the web application's input fields.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 This limitation sparked an innovative idea: what if we could bypass the encryption and fuzz the web application at the browser layer instead of the HTTP layer? This approach would allow us to interact with the web application as if we were a user, bypassing the need to break the encryption of HTTP traffic.\n\nThe result? BrowserBruter, the world's first advanced browser-based automated web application penetration testing tool! By controlling browsers and injecting payloads into input fields, BrowserBruter bypasses encryption and automates the process of sending payloads to web application input fields in the browser.\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0",

We signed up with them to boost my wfh WiFi but we noticed today that our router went missing after the tech was here. I was using our own modem and router so not only was it not comcast property, but Verizon had no right to take it. Are we in a security danger if the Verizon tech has our router and has this happened to anyone else? My red flags are absolutely raised that we had a bad actor in our house with access to our network. \n\nAm I overreacting??",

I'm now seeking insights on creating policies for users who are on extended leaves, such as medical, parental, or long vacations exceeding a month. Specifically, I'm concerned about users intermittently accessing company assets, like checking emails briefly without being available for remediation due to being out of the office or lacking a VPN connection. Currently, neither HR nor our information security team has established policies in this regard. HR has rightfully noted that company assets are tied to users' benefits and payroll, which I fully understand. I'm reaching out to see if anyone has successfully implemented a policy that both HR and Security agree upon, ensuring users refrain from using company devices during extended leaves. Also, please let me know if I'm chasing a pipe dream and it's not possible \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThank you for your insights!",

A well informed HR team will expect employees that are out on leave to be out and offline. \n\nThere are also rules relating to FMLA, disability, and other programs that do not permit the employee to work during these periods. By working they could potentially put their benefits in jeopardy.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, what happens if the user is due for annual training while they are out. You can't make them take the training while they are out and they would be noncompliant if their annual Awareness or other training is not current.\n\nWe would follow this as a general rule and make exceptions when required as it was for a small company of 200 employees.",

It basically means that, HR, IT Ops (I'm guessing you're within this department), and information security should work together in determining provisioning of access privileges and rights when onboarding, off boarding and during the retention period of an employee; that includes when employees are on leave, suspended, promoted, demoted or moving departments.",

This reduces the output and makes it more readable\n   * Implemented `json` format for output\n   * The new option `--schema` parameter, allowing to make a schema diff between the previous dump and the current. This is useful for checking if the schema has been changed after the migration. By controlling it data leakage after migration can be excluded\n* Improved Hash transformer - added salt parameter and `GREENMASK_GLOBAL_SALT` variable. Added sha3 functions support in different modes.\n* Remastered `Cmd` transformer `json` interaction driver. Now the json records are represented by the [column name and its value](https://greenmask.io/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/cmd/#json). This simplifying scripting\n* Fixed `restore` command parameters that are responsible for partial database restoration\n\nIf you are not familiar yet with Greenmask - it is a Database obfuscation tool that brings wide obfuscation functionalities and techniques. Check out the [Playgroup page](https://greenmask.io/playground/) to get started",

Also make sure to disable any host/guest sharing. Depending on the VM software you use, you might not be able to move files back and forth between host and guest, but that's about the only drawback ( and doesn't happen in all VM software).",

Are there cost-effective patch management tools that operate on a host-based model, fetch updates from the web (eliminating the need for VPN connectivity), and seamlessly integrate with SCCM?\n\n2.What effective policies or methodologies can be implemented to enable users to access personal data like payslips and accolades on personal devices without resorting to copying or emailing, ensuring secure and convenient data access?\n\nI greatly appreciate everyone's time and feedback! \n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f ",

It's pretty good.\n\nMy opinion, and the longer answer to your question, is that depending on the size and scope of your organisation you need to say goodbye to any concept of being 100% patch compliant. Pushing updates via SCCM is obviously a good start, but workstations won't be patched if employees don't turn them on, or servers might not be patched if applications are not compatible, or app owners might not want to implement a patch if it breaks a business process, etc. There are lots of reasons why you might not get 100% patching, and lots of them are out of your control. \n\nInstead you should work towards setting up a strong vulnerability management process. Introduce an exceptions policy, exceptions register, and processes for tracking and reviewing these exceptions. Make these are really really robust and comprehensive. Educate your Board/Senior Leadership on the process and what the key exceptions mean and the risks to your business that are associated with them.\n\nFor personal devices you need to look into BYOD, MDM/MAM solutions. There's lots out there. If your company has Microsoft you can use Intune for this.",

I will try to answer this question expressly based on my experience. \n\nPentest is more about technology while compliance focus on governance and management. I used to work as a member of incident response team for more than 3 years and I worked closely with pentest colleagues. It is certainly cool when u find fatal errors or blackholes during work, pentest needs numerous knowledge about network, hardware, data, architecture etc, which means there's a lot of things u can learn from this job.\n\nCurrently I take the role of compliance officer for 3years. Compliance requirements you need to be familiar with related provisions, regulations etc(don't worry, u don't need to know every provision very clearly at this time, you will master them in your work.). Then you need to help business teams design and implement an appropriate mechanism to  support both business development and compliance requirements from supervisors.",

Actually, if you choose compliance field, maybe you could ask your mentor or interviewee for some regulations or files related to this work at this time. There's no much things you need to learn in advance because compliance work is more about Experiential Work, you will master and handle it in your real daily work, just like security assessment. The more situations you encounter, the more familiar you will be with how to deal with them. Btw, do you like to communicate with people? If not, then pentest maybe be suited for you.",

        "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm hoping someone can give me some guidance on security certificates. I've been in IT for 10 years - 9 years as a SysAdmin and now am a Solutions Architect (mostly client facing process automations but trying to work my way back into more infrastructure and systems automation). I have set up some SSL certificates for sites, Ubiquiti, NPS for 802.1x, etc... over the years but it's probably one of my weakest points in IT. I just follow instructions without really knowing what I'm doing or what each piece of the private/public keys are. My ability to troubleshoot certificate/key related issues is non-existent. I was wondering if anyone had any good resources for learning the fundamental and practical use of security certificates, encryption keys, etc... \n\nI've been working on my homelab a bit more lately and am currently working on setting up Terraform to spin up VMs in vSphere, AWS, and Azure and then use Ansible to configure them. I really like the SSH set up with AWS EC2 instances with generating the key, downloading the private key and then calling it in Ansible to access the server. I have that piece specifically working. Now I'm trying to set that up with local Ubuntu servers (based on templates) on my vSphere servers. I'm also trying to integrate Hashicorp Vault into my architecture to remove hardcoded passwords and api keys in my files and need to generate and install some OpenSSH keys for communications between my servers to get that and the templates working. That's where I decided it was probably time to dive into them and get a better idea of how they work and best practices for managing them. \n\nI probably used the wrong terminology at some point for certificates/keys/etc... further pointing out that I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to this. \n\nThis is my first time posting here. I was going to post to r/SysAdmin or r/InformationTechnology but didn't know if this subreddit would be better given the specificity of what I'm hoping to learn. Please let me know if I should post somewhere else and I'll happily move over there. \n\nThanks in advance!",

If you don't give it credentials it will only scan and report on what it can see from outside the system. The licensing model is different for network based scans.",

Your experiences, lessons learned, and insights would be invaluable in helping me shape a similar service in Australia.\n\n  \nSpecifically, I'm interested in:  \nSetting Up Your Business: What were the key steps and challenges in setting up a business focused on cyber security assessments?\n\n  \nSystems and Applications: What systems, tools, or applications do you use to conduct and manage these assessments effectively?\n\n  \nLessons Learned: Any key lessons or advice you'd wish to share with someone looking to start a similar service?\n\n  \nClient Engagement: How do you approach and engage with small businesses for these assessments?  \n\n\nAny Other Tips: Anything else you think might be helpful or wish you knew when you started out.  \n\n\nFeel free to share your stories, tips, and any other information you think might be beneficial. I am all ears and truly appreciate the time and effort to help guide a fellow cyber security enthusiast on the other side of the world.  \n\n\nBest to private message me as I suspect you may not want to reveal some of your business secrets to other UK based businesses.\n\n  \nThank you so much in advance!",

My question is how can they improve here we don't have a lot of crazy incidents (ransomware, viruses etc) mostly some admin does stupid things and it triggers alerts. The idea is to move into a DFIR role in the future, but with my current job, I don't think I will gain any experience or knowledge to achieve that goal. I have certifications like Security+, eJPT, BTL1 and CCNA. If you have any other certification that would help me or any platform (like tryhackme) or anything else that would be great.\n\nThank you.",

        "body": "I am writing this post there because I suspect there could be **people who have the same pain** in the neck with **database obfuscation**. I would love to see **any feedback about design and solution**. I got a few questions that would love to hear from you. If you wish to have a deep dive about it read the passage after the questionary.  \nThe questions to consider are:\n\n* Is data **obfuscation** is hot topic in your experience?\n* Do you see **value** in obfuscation tools and frameworks for data obfuscation?\n* Should the development and research in this area **continue** in your opinion?\n\n**Details are below:**  \n**I have been working as a database administrator** for almost a decade and have spent a vast amount of time in database obfuscation while delivering safely anonymized dumps from production to the staging environments or providing it for analyzing purposes for analytics. And I was always struggling with a lack of technology in this area. That\u2019s why I started to develop this project on my own using my experience with understanding the pros and cons of the current solution and developing something that would be extensible, reliable, and easily maintainable for the whole software lifecycle.  \n**Mostly the obfuscation process was:**\n\n* Build **complicated SQL** scripts and integrate them into a kind of service that is going to apply those queries and store the obfuscated data\n* Confirm the obfuscation procedure with the **information security team**\n* **Maintain the schema changes** during the whole software lifecycle\n\nThe main problem is each business has **domain-specific data** and you cannot just provide transformation for every purpose, you just can implement basic transformers and provide a comprehensive framework where users can design their obfuscation procedure. In other words obfuscation it\u2019s also a kind of software development and it should be covered with all features that are used in ordinary development (CI/CD, security review, and so on).  \nAfter all, I **collected** the things that would be **valuable** in this software:\n\n* The only reliable schema dump must be performed by the **vendor utilities**\n* Customization - possibility to **implement your transformer**\n* Validation - possibility to **validate the schema** you are obfuscating\n* Functional dependencies transformation - possibility to perform **transformation** when one column **value depends on another**\n* Backward compatible and reliable - I want to have strictly the same schema and objects from production but without original valuable information\n\n**And I started to develop** [Greenmask](https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask)**.**   \nGreenmask is going to be a core of the obfuscation system. Currently, it is only working with **PostgreSQL** though a few other DBMS are on the way.\n\nI'd like to highlight the key technological aspects that define Greenmask's design and engineering:\n\n* Greenmask **delegates schema dumping** and restoration to pg\\_dump and pg\\_restore, while it handles table data dumping and transformation autonomously.\n* Designed fo**r full compatibility with standard PostgreSQL utilities**. To achieve this, I undertook the task of porting a few essential libraries:\n   * **COPY Format Parser**: While initially considering using the CSV format and the default Go parser, I encountered issues related to NULL value determination and parsing performance. Despite these challenges, this approach ensures nearly 100% compatibility with standard utilities, allowing you to effortlessly restore dumps using pg\\_restore without any complications.\n   * **TOC Library of PostgreSQL**: One of the primary challenges we faced in this project was the need for precise control over the restoration process. For instance, you might want to restore only a single table instead of an entire massive database. After extensive research, it became clear that using the pg\\_dump/pg\\_restore in directory format offered the best control. However, there was a gap in available Go implementations for this functionality.\n* The core design philosophy **revolves around customization** because there is no one-size-fits-all solution suitable for every business domain. Greenmask empowers users to implement their own transformations, whether for individual columns or for multi-column transformations with functional dependencies.\n* Greenmask transformers **offer multiple customization options**, including:\n   * Implement your **custom transformer** (in Go or Python) with PIPE interaction using formats like JSON, CSV, or TEXT.\n   * **Using templates**, which include pre-defined Go template functions and record template functions, enables you to create multi-column transformations in a way that resembles traditional imperative programming.\n   * **Using CMD transformers**, allows you to interface your data with external programs written in any language and facilitate interaction via formats such as JSON, CSV, or TEXT.\n* Greenmask has **integration with PostgreSQL driver (pgx)**. It was designed to make the tool powerful and customizable. In my point of view transformation is engineering work and for doing that you should use an appropriate tool set for doing whatever you want. Perform schema introspection and initialize table driver that could encode and decode raw column data properly\n* Via data that was gathered during schema introspection, greenmask notifies you about **potential problems via warnings**. It verbosely says about potential constraint violation or other events for your awareness\n\nThis project started because of **experiences** and the fact that there weren't many tools available. It's being developed by a small group of people with limited resources, so your feedback is incredibly valuable. An early beta was released about a month ago, and getting ready to release a more polished version in mid-January. \n\n**If you're interested in this area**, you can check out the project and get started by visiting  [GitHub page](https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask). \n\nI\u2019d appreciate your thoughts and involvement.",

        "body": "Hey crew - Here's another blog post and [video](https://youtu.be/fwT3L5qw7Q8). This time around we're discussing what future AI-driven operating systems will look like, the implications, and initial considerations for securing them.\n\nSee the full post below and TLDR. For a better reading experience with graphics, images, links, etc. I recommend [reading on my site](https://www.dylandavis.net/2023/12/securing-the-new-era-of-ai-driven-operating-systems-a-novices-tale/).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this content, [feel free to subscribe](https://embeds.beehiiv.com/025f95aa-709c-46bc-88f7-1550d56f0714) to my weekly newsletter covering similar topics.\n\nTL;DR: The blog post explores the concept of AI-driven operating systems (GenAI OS), predicting a future where AI, particularly LLMs, are central to our devices. It compares traditional and GenAI OS components, discusses new user interfaces like voice and gestures, and examines the shift from traditional software to AI-centric tools. The post also addresses the security challenges of GenAI OS and suggests potential solutions.\n\n\\---\n\nFULL POST - **Securing the New Era of AI-Driven Operating Systems: A Novice's Tale**\n\n\\---\n\nImagine a world where you\u2019re interacting with a device (computer, phone, etc.) you no longer need to switch between applications or frequently use your hands for, but instead, you\u2019re using your voice and gestures. Chatting with your device allows you to achieve all the tasks you have in mind. Over time, that device will proactively take more tasks off your hands, completing them effortlessly and enhancing the quality of each output. And weirdly, sounds like Scarlett Johansson\n\nThis description offers a glimpse into the remarkable movie \"Her,\" which I highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet. It's the most optimistic portrayal of humanity's future dynamic with AI.\n\nToday, many cool kids within generative AI (GenAI) are exploring the concept of operating systems. Specifically, they are considering what it would look like if GenAI were the central element of our devices, functioning as an operating system (OS). When playing this scenario out, the possibilities are exciting but also scary.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. In September 2023, Andrej Karpathy (one of the ML prophets) brought widespread attention to the idea of GenAI being at the heart of our future OS. Interestingly, I discovered another smarty pants discussing this concept earlier in April 2023. Between April and September, conversations about the GenAI OS began to merge and intensify.\n\nTwo months later, in November 2023, Andrej doubled down on this idea of a GenAI OS by sharing a diagram with some additional thoughts. But before diving into the future GenAI OS, it's important to understand the purpose of existing operating systems.\n\n**Why do operating systems exist?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the fundamental question\u2026 What is the purpose of an operating system?\n\nThe purpose has evolved (great video on its evolution), but today, its main mission is to serve as the connector between user intent and the actions executed by the hardware and software on the device. An OS is made of different parts, the primary components are - the kernel, memory, external devices (like a mouse and keyboard), file systems, the CPU, and the user interface (UI). There are more, but we\u2019ll keep it simple.\n\nThe kernel is at the core of it all, ensuring user applications (everything we interact with) have sufficient compute and memory resources to achieve their job in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nBeyond the kernel, the OS provides several critical functions. It offers a user-friendly interface, typically graphical for most of us normies (not command-line), enabling easy interaction with computers. It also handles the storage, retrieval, and organization of data, making accessing and managing information easier for users and applications. Furthermore, OS\u2019s are crucial for maintaining system security, managing user permissions, and protecting against external threats. Lastly, they communicate with hardware through drivers, translating input like mouse movements into actionable instructions.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of an OS, let\u2019s look at the mapping between current and future GenAI OS\u2019s.\n\n**Old school OS vs. GenAI OS**\n\nWe\u2019re heading into uncharted territory, so be warned! Pontificating about a fundamentally new OS will come with some serious assumptions and logical leaps, but I promise most of it makes sense. \ud83d\ude09\n\nLet's begin with a bulleted list comparing traditional OS components to their counterparts in a GenAI OS:\n\n* &#x200B;\n\nCPU = Orchestrator LLM\n\n* RAM = Context Window\n* Virtual memory = MemGPT\n* External storage = Vector DB\n* Software 1.0 = Python interpreter, calculator, etc.\n* App Store = Other finetuned LLMs\n* Browser = LLM with internet access\n* Devices (mouse/keyboard) = LLM generated voice, text, video, image\n\nHere\u2019s what it all looks like mashed together in modified versions of Adrej\u2019s original diagram ([Link to image](https://www.dylandavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-110330.png)).\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll walk you through each section. Let\u2019s start with how users will interact with the GenAI-powered OS of the future.\n\nI'm 63.7% confident that gestures and voice will be the primary ways we interact with devices in the future. Our GenAI OS will communicate through voice, video, image, or a blend of these. Imagine an adaptable UI, transforming based on the task, unlike static interfaces like Gmail, Excel, or PowerPoint.\n\nWe\u2019re steadily progressing towards this future - the question is, do you see it?\n\nHere's why this is plausible: Apple's Vision Pro introduces hand and eye tracking, advancing gesture control. OpenAI's ChatGPT mobile app, arguably this year's most underrated launch, brought voice interactions into the spotlight. Finally, the Humane AI Pin, a wearable AI companion, captured the internet's attention (TED talk).\n\nOnce our user interacts with this new GenAI OS, what happens next?\n\nAt the core of our GenAI OS is what I call the \u201corchestrator LLM\u201d, functioning as both kernel and CPU. Managed by giants like OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic. This centralized role will orchestrate everything - retrieving data, updating memory, accessing the internet, pulling in other fintuned models, or leveraging software 1.0 tools (i.e. calculator). This is the brains of the operation.\n\nA researcher named Beren provides insight that allows interesting comparisons between traditional and GenAI OS CPUs. For example, traditional CPU units are bits in registers, while in GenAI OS, they are tokens in the context window.\n\nTraditional computers gauge performance via CPU operations (FLOPs) and RAM. In contrast, GenAI OS performance, like GPT4, is measured by context length and Natural Language Operations (NLOPs = made-up term) per second. To illustrate, GPT4's 128K context length is akin to an Apple IIe's 128KB RAM from 1983. Each generation of about 100 tokens represents one NLOP. GPT4 operates at 1 NLOP/sec, while GPT3.5 turbo achieves 10 NLOPs/sec. Although slower than the billions of FLOPs/sec of CPUs, NLOPs are more complex.\n\nAs larger LLMs evolve, we'll increasingly rely on them, paving the way for autonomous agents. Both Andrej and Anshuman (Hugging Face) speculate future GenAI OS versions will likely have autonomous agents working on our behalf to achieve macro tasks and self-improving through tasks that have reinforcement learning available. Crazy, I know!\n\nWe don\u2019t have time to get into future versions of this GenAI OS today, but that could be an interesting future blog post.\n\nIn both traditional and GenAI OSs, we\u2019ll need memory. The most common setup for memory within OS is RAM and disk storage. But what does that mean? Simply put, RAM sits inside our working memory (internal storage), making it easy to access quickly, but is limited in size. Disk storage is external and takes more time to retrieve, but it has more space for storing information.\n\nOur GenAI OS will have a similar setup. The RAM is our context window, currently 128k in GPT-4, and the disk storage is represented by a vector database like Pinecone or ChromaDB. The amount of storage available in our vector database can vary, but for our purposes let\u2019s say infinity and beyond!\n\nSo, there's this cool paper from UC Berkeley, dubbed MemGPT. These folks are rehashing an old-school OS idea for LLMs: virtual memory. It\u2019s a slick move computers use when they're short on physical memory, shuffling data between RAM and disk storage as needed.\n\nIn our GenAI world, the orchestrator LLM takes the wheel on memory management. It's a smart conductor, knowing exactly what context is needed based on user actions. Seamlessly moving data between the main context window (RAM) and vector database (disk).\n\nEven though we're eyeing the future, we\u2019ll still need some software 1.0 tools before completely leaving that world behind. But\u2026 over time I think these tools will gradually disappear.\n\nIn GenAI OS's first version, we're still going to lean on stuff like Python interpreters, calculators, terminals, and so on. The importance of tools like this is self-explanatory.\n\nBut what about GenAI OS versions 2 or 3? As hinted earlier, we're already seeing a dip in our dependence on old-school software 1.0 tools. Like those whispers about OpenAI\u2019s Q\\* cracking grade school math, or BLIP-2's finding on LLMs communicating in some high-dimension space we humans can't understand.\n\nIt's tough to say when we'll fully ditch software 1.0, but my guess? It might happen way sooner than we're all thinking.\n\nNow, let's talk about getting online. Good news: we've already tackled this with ChatGPT, which has Bing search baked right in. Sure, there\u2019s room to grow in terms of response speed, quality, and sourcing, but these are things that'll likely get better as we go.\n\nLast we have an interesting concept shared by Andrej in a recent video around a future LLM app store, similar to Apple or Google\u2019s app store today. In our GenAI OS scenario, our orchestrator LLM will download smaller finetuned models from the LLM app store and work together to achieve tasks more efficiently.\n\nLast up, there's this neat idea from Andrej's recent video about a future LLM app store, kind of like what Apple or Google have now. In our GenAI OS setup, the orchestrator LLM will grab smaller, fine-tuned models from this LLM app store, working with them to complete macro tasks (think autonomous agents).\n\nThis strategy, using fine-tuned LLMs, is a time-saver and cost-cutter, while amping up the response quality. For example, instead of just using GPT-4 for coding, we could pull Google\u2019s AlphaCode 2 for even higher-quality code at a lower cost.\n\nNow that we've scoped out our future GenAI OS architecture, I've got one last traditional vs. GenAI OS market comparison to share.\n\n**The evolution of closed and open GenAI OS**\n\nSimilar to the traditional OS market we\u2019ve observed a divide between the LLMs that will likely drive future GenAI OS\u2019s.\n\nIn the GenAI OS realm, we're seeing a split similar to the traditional OS market. The closed-source heavyweights include big names like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. What's interesting is how the open-source LLM landscape mirrors the old-school setup. Just as Linux and Unix are foundations of many open-source OSs, Llama (by Meta) might anchor future open-source GenAI OSs, along with one or two others like Falcon, Mistral, etc.\n\nThat said, the meaning of 'open-source' is evolving, leaning towards less openness. Traditional open-source purists argue that true openness should encompass the codebase, dataset, and model, not just the model alone.\n\n**Securing the future GenAI OS**\n\nAs I delved into this future GenAI OS concept, my security alarm bells were ringing non-stop. I couldn't help but imagine all the risky scenarios of entrusting our personal and financial data to an orchestrator LLM at the heart of our OSs. But lucky for you, I'm a techno-optimist, not your usual security skeptic. I believe we'll find ways to beef up these systems' security.\n\nTo kick things off, I'll first outline which traditional security measures could be adapted to our new GenAI OS world. Then, I'll touch on some LLM-specific security strategies to consider.\n\nFor this post, let's keep it simple and categorize the security practices into three groups: Old, \u201cold but new\u201d, and net new.\n\n**Old**\n\nFor our GenAI OS version 1, we'll want to import some tried-and-true security measures like authentication, software supply chain (SSC) validation/verification, and encryption.\n\nAuthentication: With voice and gestures as our main interaction modes, biometric authentication will be key. We're talking voice, face, or fingerprint recognition here. I can already hear the security folks in the crowd screaming about how it's possible to bypass these forms of authentication, especially voice (thanks to GenAI). But by integrating passkey and cutting-edge tech to sniff out fake biometrics, we're heading towards solving these issues.\n\nSoftware supply chain (SSC): Our orchestrator LLM will rely on software 1.0 tools and finetuned LLMs from the LLM app store, both of which will be vulnerable to upstream attacks. The example for software 1.0 tools is clear, with companies facing constant SSC attacks. For LLMs, the challenge is tougher, given the nascent state of SSC security tools. A good starting point? Ensuring downloaded LLMs come from their claimed publishers (think SLSA for LLMs).\n\nEncryption: Considering that our GenAI OS's vector database will store heaps of personal info (like social security numbers, health records, and financial details), encrypting this data whether at rest, in transit, or potentially even in use, is critical.\n\n**Old, but new**\n\nMoving on, let's explore some traditional security practices reimagined with an LLM spin:\n\nAuthorization/Segmentation: I'm grouping these, as they both aim to address different angles of a similar challenge. We have the dual LLM architecture and control tokens. Dual LLMs are all about splitting privileged and non-privileged LLMs. Privileged LLMs will have the ability to cause serious damage if taken over by an attacker, so all outside access is delegated to the non-privileged LLM (see more here). Control tokens, on the other hand, aim for a clear-cut separation at the token level between user inputs and system instructions. This is to ward off common prompt injection attacks. Think of it like \u201cspecial tokens\u201d in today's terms, where you tell the LLM to sandwich specific types of info within set brackets (e.g., \\[CODE\\] \u2026 \\[/CODE\\]). It's similar to how we separate user and kernel land in traditional OSs.\n\nVulnerability scanning: Outside of traditional vulnerability scanning of software 1.0 tools, we're witnessing an evolution in scanning tools specifically for LLMs. This includes emerging tools focused on testing LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Notable examples include Garak and PromptMap.\n\n**Net new**\n\nFinally, we have the net new security practices, here we're mainly talking about LLM evaluations. I\u2019ve written more on this topic in another post, so I\u2019ll keep this concise. In a nutshell, using LLMs to evaluate other LLMs\u2019 output is the most effective way defenders have found to ensure that the LLMs aren't up to any mischief, leaking private info, or churning out vulnerable code.\n\nWhew, that was a bit of a marathon post! I still have open-ended questions, but I\u2019m curious, what do you think?! Is this all crazy talk? Can we realistically envision an OS revolving around LLMs? And what are the big hurdles that might stop us from reaching this future?\n\nFor all of you who have made it this far, thank you. I hope this gives you a clearer picture of what our future GenAI OS might entail, how it could operate, and the initial steps toward securing it.",

        "body": "Hey crew - I wanted to share a blog post and a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/SRklKiiz8Gs) debunking a data leakage myth I run into constantly when speaking with security teams about using closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT in the enterprise. \n\nSee the full post below and TLDR. For a better reading experience with graphics, images, links, etc. I recommend reading on [my site](https://www.dylandavis.net/2023/11/why-the-data-theft-scare-over-chatgpt-is-utter-nonsense/#top)\n\n If you\u2019re interested in this content, [feel free to subscribe](https://embeds.beehiiv.com/025f95aa-709c-46bc-88f7-1550d56f0714) to my weekly newsletter covering similar topics.   \n**TL;DR:** The perceived risk of data leakage from using LLMs like ChatGPT is largely exaggerated, with actual threats being minimal, especially compared to the substantial productivity benefits they offer; the real but still modest risk lies with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) LLMs, not standard models like GPT-4.\n\n\\---\n\nFULL POST - **Why the data theft scare over ChatGPT is utter nonsense**\n\n\\---\n\n**The myth**\n\nSamsung caused a stir by prohibiting their employees from using LLMs like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, sparking a trend among other companies.\n\nThe myth is that if my employee inputs sensitive data (IP, PII, etc.) into ChatGPT, then a threat actor or competitor on the other end might be able to fish the data out, leading to serious data leakage issues. I\u2019ll admit, when I first caught wind of this, I nodded along, figuring they had insider info I was missing.\n\nBut then\u2026 this same anxiety kept popping up from others in every chat I had about LLM security. And it hit me: nobody dug deep into the actual risk, which, spoiler alert, is pretty darn small with closed-source foundational models like ChatGPT. More on that in a bit.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many reasons why security teams default to playing it safe and cutting their employees off from using LLMs, but the cost/benefit ratio is massive. \n\nNow, I get why security teams might play it safe and cut off access to LLMs, but they\u2019re missing out on the benefits, big time. For example, one study showed employees using LLMs were 14% \u2013 34% more productive per hour than those not using them. Keep in mind that we\u2019re still at the beginning of how this technology will transform how we work, so I\u2019m happy to bet that this % will increase significantly. \n\nHere\u2019s another piece of the puzzle many overlook: ChatGPT comes with its own \u201csecurity net\u201d. When inputting data into ChatGPT OpenAI is running through multiple steps to ensure they\u2019re not using sensitive data to train their models. An obvious step would be filtering out easily detectable PII (SSN, phone number, etc.) before training. \n\nFrom the GPT-4 Technical Paper: \u201cWe take several steps to reduce the risk that our models are used in a way that could violate a person\u2019s privacy rights. These include fine-tuning models to reject these requests, removing personal information from the training dataset where feasible, creating automated model evaluations, monitoring and responding to user attempts to generate this type of information, and restricting this type of use in our terms and policies.\u201d\n\nAnd the cherry on top? You can opt out of having your data used for training. This isn\u2019t new; it\u2019s been an option for months.\n\n**Why data leakage isn\u2019t a risk**\n\nThe fundamental job of an LLM is to generate text. Simply guessing what the next word (token) will be. A common misconception is that LLMs act like data banks, storing user information. This is a fundamental misunderstanding, leading to misguided decisions and a loss of potential productivity gains.\n\nBefore diving deeper into my argument I want to flag a 2021 study involving GPT-2. Researchers extracted sensitive data (like names and phone numbers) because the model had inadvertently \u201cmemorized\u201d this information. Remember, LLMs are designed to generalize, not memorize. Such instances of data recall are rare exceptions, not the norm.\n\nSo, you might be thinking, \u201cDoes this mean LLMs can store and leak my data?\u201d Generally, no. Here\u2019s why:\n\nThe likelihood of a model memorizing your data is based on three variables. \n\n* Frequency in the dataset: The number of times the specific user\u2019s data appears in the training dataset. I.e. upload the same SSN into ChatGPT (X) times. \n* Dataset size: The total volume of data (words or tokens) used for training.\n* Memorization tendency: A hypothetical constant indicating how likely a model is to retain specific data, influenced by its design, size, and training approach. This is a hypothetical number and will vary between different models and training setups.\n\nYou can picture the basic formula below. \n\nLet\u2019s guess at some numbers and see how likely it is for our data to be memorized. \n\n* Frequency in the dataset: Let\u2019s assume the specific user\u2019s SSN appears 5 million times in the training dataset.\n* Dataset size: Let\u2019s set the estimated dataset size at 500 billion words.\n   * *Note: I\u2019m being VERY conservative. LLAMA 2 was trained on 2 trillion tokens and I\u2019m sure GPT-4 has more, which likely equates to a little less than 2 trillion words.* \n* Memorization tendency: For the sake of this example, let\u2019s assume a very small value, say 0.1, to represent the model\u2019s tendency to memorize specific data.\n\nWe have our numbers plugged in and the likelihood of memorization is 0.000001. That\u2019s a one-in-a-million chance of data leakage. You know what else has a one-in-a-million chance? Being struck by lightning, finding a four-leaf clover, or having a meteorite land in your backyard. \n\nDo you now see how ridiculous this concern is? But that\u2019s not all, there\u2019s more. \n\nCaleb Sima from the Cloud Security Alliance listed three quality reasons as to why the likelihood of data leakage is blown out of proportion. \n\n* Memory threshold: My main argument. We need a ridiculous number of references for the LLM to memorize anything meaningful. I.e. 5 million of the same SSN uploaded into a model trained on a dataset of 500 billion. \n* Formatting: You have to have enough of the secret or format of the secret to match the pattern to generate accurately. \n* Accuracy: Lastly, the most difficult. You must determine whether the response is accurate or not a hallucination. \n\nConsidering these factors, along with OpenAI\u2019s efforts to filter sensitive data before training, it becomes evident that most concerns about LLM data leaks are overblown.\n\n**The real risk**\n\nSure, there\u2019s a legitimate risk of data leakage, but it\u2019s mostly with LLMs using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.\n\nAs you can see from the above diagram we\u2019ve included new items. This setup includes a vector database and agents (like GPTs). It\u2019s like giving your LLM a library card to access external info beyond its training data. And yeah, that can be dicey. \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: The real risk of sensitive data theft is higher with RAG-based LLMs, which are often part of existing products, not the basic models everyone freaks out about.\n\nThe risk is there, but it\u2019s subtle. And subtlety matters big time here. We\u2019re talking about holding back your company from nailing more ideas, productivity, and, let\u2019s not forget, revenue and market growth.\n\nNext time the security panic button gets hit, pause and think about the cost vs. benefit. Is the payoff huge? Then maybe it\u2019s time to ditch the herd mentality and draw your map.",

When inputting data into ChatGPT OpenAI is running through multiple steps to ensure they\u2019re not using sensitive data to train their models. An obvious step would be filtering out easily detectable PII (SSN, phone number, etc.) before training. \n\nIf you've worked in information security, you have likely encountered a technology known as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) -- it's a common task for lower level infosec analysts to sort through DLP hits and review for false positives. The entire purpose of the technology is to monitor for sensitive data patterns and prevent prohibited data from being sent via email or across a network in an unsecured format.\n\nAnd as anyone who has worked with such technology can tell you, it misses stuff *all the time*.\n\nSo what specific steps are OpenAI verifiably taking to filter out sensitive data from training data? And why do you think they will be able to do so much better a job than companies who specifically focus on DLP?\n\nThere's a lot of sensitive data out there, and a lot of different ways it can be stored. And OpenAI doesn't actually lose anything if they miss something, because it's not *their* data getting exposed.\n\n>From the GPT-4 Technical Paper: \u201cWe take several steps to reduce the risk that our models are used in a way that could violate a person\u2019s privacy rights. These include fine-tuning models to reject these requests, removing personal information from the training dataset where feasible, creating automated model evaluations, monitoring and responding to user attempts to generate this type of information, and restricting this type of use in our terms and policies.\u201d\n\nThat's all very nice. But some folks from Google Deep Mind published a paper demonstrating a trivial attack capable of causing ChatGPT to dump its training data verbatim, much of which contained email addresses, phone numbers, and other such information.\n\nhttps://not-just-memorization.github.io/extracting-training-data-from-chatgpt.html\n\nA company's policy is *not* a security control. It does absolutely nothing to actually stop anything from happening.\n\nAnd whatever steps they're taking to scrub their training data, there is empirical proof that these steps are far from foolproof.\n\nSo no, it's not \"utter nonsense\" -- there are (or were, as I suspect OpenAI is moving fast to address this specific attack whether or not it resolves the underlying vulnerability) proven and trivially exploitable attacks against the production version of ChatGPT that can expose sensitive data caught up in the training data.\n\nIt is fine to argue that such concerns may be overblown, or that the benefit outweighs the risk. Security teams do tend to be biased towards shutting things down to avoid loss in the current state rather than thinking about whether that will cause far greater loss in the form of lost potential.\n\nBut they're not \"utter nonsense\".\n\n>We\u2019re talking about holding back your company from nailing more ideas, productivity, and, let\u2019s not forget, revenue and market growth.\n\n>Next time the security panic button gets hit, pause and think about the cost vs. benefit. Is the payoff huge? Then maybe it\u2019s time to ditch the herd mentality and draw your map.\n\nSo can you disclose the risk vs reward calculation you are using to determine this?\n\nYou are claiming that the cost of loss from data exposure is less than the gain someone will get from using LLM to do various things. Which implies you are making some assumptions about these values.\n\nSo I'd like to know what you estimate the cost of data loss to be in this assessment, what you project the payoff will be, and why you believe the values are whatever you are assuming they are?\n\nCosts and payoffs don't have to be purely monetary -- factor in whatever non-monetary elements you feel are appropriate.\n\nBut if you don't have some concrete figures backing this up, how can you possibly make the claim that these concerns are overblown?\n\nIf you don't have some concrete figures backing this up, it suggests you aren't actually making a rational calculation here, but are rather just blowing off security as concern (possibly because I suspect you don't perceive yourself as responsible for dealing with security incidents when they occur). \n\nLike, what do you lose if you're wrong about this? Anything? Because if not, it doesn't seem like you have sufficient skin in this game to be considered an unbiased actor...and you're definitely not disclosing the biases you *do* have.",

Especially since I wouldn't expect a company to just straight up disclose noncompliance with legal requirements to someone who isn't even their employee yet. You might hear things like \"policy creation initiatives\" or \"compliance initiatives\" or NOT hear them actually having information about where you would get information or other points of contact.   \n\nIn response to questions about vuln mgmt, etc., you might hear them say things like \"that's something you'd be expected to create.\" Which tells you they don't already have it.  \n\nThen you have the opening, if you dare to take it, to ask about how they've handled it previously, and how they've handled compliance previously.   \n\nReally, if the answers aren't comforting, that tells you what you need to know without making them squirm too hard by directly putting your finger on this huge problem before you're even employed. And that will tell you whether you want this job and if they're paying enough for it.",

My big complaint with abnormal is that they need the email to be fully delivered before they engage with it. They claim emails are actioned within milliseconds on their website, but the contract actually says otherwise. We sometimes saw minutes and occasionally hours in delay. It wasn't common to see hours, but it did happen. It was more common to see 10-40 minutes, though. \n\nWith that said, the tool was very good at detecting novel phishing attacks. They also allowed you to submit emails for question and improvement. They would give meaningful responses and change the platform based on what they found. \n\nIs abnormal better than nothing? Big time. Is it the best, no. \n\nI don't have experience with Tessian.",

Middle of the rman backup routine.  \n\nThey've recently tried to restore from a backup and were surprised and shaken when it didn't work. The dba team blamed the issue on incrementals being used and poor timing of when the network backup was launched.  Several other backups were tested with the same results.  \n\nThe dba team never verifies their backups (which have traditionally gone to tape).  Never.  Ever.   \n Realistically, isn't that the root cause of the problem?  I'm looking at talking to the security team to do some coaching to the dba folks on how to better secure their data. ",

And no online transactions.\n\nSo couldn't an outsider physically wiretap these lines? I only read about skimming but it seems like that requires the fraud to be committed by the owner.\n\nAny recoded incidents? Any explanations or articles appreciated.

Them for the unauthorized sharing of that data when they were granted access under implied confidentiality (the phone was not theirs, they were just given access based on trust).\n\nIf this was an issue in a customer company, I'd advise the the employee get mandatory security awareness training, and that - if possible - materials also be made available for review by whoever they gave the passcode to.

So looking at them individually is problematic, but that's how I would weigh them. \n\nNo doubt attachments are one of the biggest attack vectors still so it makes sense to rank it \"biggest\" imo, but it's an oversimplification since depending on your organization/work culture randomly sending excel files, PDF documents etc might be perfectly normal, and in that case a foreign/unknown sender is a \"bigger\"/clearer red flag for instance. So it's a matter of looking at the final sum of red flags and compare it to the baseline/trends of the company in question.",

Virustotal will also share the file with all of the AV companies who subscribe to their service.\n\n3) Depending on your experience, you can perform 'dynamic analysis' on the file, which involves running the file in an isolated environment and capturing the behaviour (system changes, actions, network connections etc). You can then pivot on these behaviours to link the malware to known malware families. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck.",

All of our non-public data is stored in the cloud, but employees can use these offices to work/collaborate if they so choose.\n\nWe'd like to improve our physical security by upgrading our badging system. Desired qualities: \n\n* SaaS-based platform for centralized management\n* Users should be able to badge in with an app using their phones\n* Information Technology/Security must be able to remotely lock/open doors\n* Information Technology/Security must be able to provision/deprovision user access\n* Access logs should be collected and retained for at least 90 days\n\nAre there any providers that this sub highly recommends? I'm happy to provide more information if needed. Thanks!",

It looked at TikTok's age verification measures for persons under 13 and found no infringement, but found the platform did not properly assess the risks to younger people registering on the service.\n\nThe regulator highlighted in its ruling Friday how children signing up had TikTok accounts set to public by default, meaning anyone could view or comment on their content.\n\nRead more: [https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230915-eu-fines-tiktok-%E2%82%AC345-million-over-child-data-breaches](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230915-eu-fines-tiktok-%E2%82%AC345-million-over-child-data-breaches) ",

Could be random technical glitches, but could be viruses or other pieces of malware. A format and reinstall cleans things up nicely, but you need to make sure to backup all your important files that aren't synced to a cloud drive.\n\nFrom a clean start, make sure you have antivirus software installed and updated regularly. Even this built-in Windows Defender is good, but go into its settings and make sure everything is turned on.\n\nThen make sure you change the User Access Control (UAC) settings so that it prompts you each time you need administrator permissions. Then, whenever you see the UAC pop-up, think carefully about what is going on and if you really need to be giving administrator access to whatever is asking for it.\n\nBe careful what software you install, and where you get it from. This includes browser add-ons and extensions.\n\nAnd it sounds like you're already into using a password manager, which is great. To go one step further, make sure you're using long random and different passwords for each site, and turn on 2FA for every site that has that option. Also, if you've had any security problems with sites, make sure you've changed your passwords on those sites recently.\nIf your passwords have been exposed in the past, these steps here are probably the most important.\n\nOn the topic of passwords, you can also check your email address against haveibeenpwned.com and make sure you've changed your password on any sites that are listed as compromised from your email address. You can also subscribe to that site for free, and if any sites you use are hacked in the future they'll email you. Then you go and change that password ASAP. (and using different passwords on each site make sure your password on one hacked site can't be reused on another)\n\nHope this helps, but feel free to ask any more questions you might have!",

Maybe try looking for some how-to videos on YouTube that show how to use that password software and see what the user interface looks like to other people.\n\nLet me know if you need recommendations on tropical islands with coconuts, palm trees, and no internet access   :)",

They have hundres of SMEs as web and mail customers.\n\n [CloudNordic Ransomware Angreb](https://cloudnordic.com/) \n\nEverything is down it seems, AD, DNS, all VMs everything.. Including both backup systems. They recommend customers retrieves a backup from web.archive.org, moves their DNS zone, and find old DNS records on securitytrails.\n\nHackers want 6 BTC, which is twice their profits last year (and they had negative result the year before). So it has been decided that they don't pay (they can't even if they wanted to). This will likely kill the company.\n\nThey suspect it was servers that was moved from one datacenter to another that ended up on the admin network by mistake that caused this.\n\nAll that said, I assume there are many small providers out there, where the backups can be hit, or are not reliable. An off-site backup, even if 30-90 days old would likely have saved the company.",

It's another concept that started with a sound bite dropped in a meeting by a tech, which was then latched onto as something that could be exploited as a buzzword, and so it's launched into the clouds somewhere. When it rains back out it comes with vague messages about tech from non-tech sources.   \nThe more common definition is around use of identity for everything. Well... we've been doing that for 2 decades. Identity Management isn't a new concept. Where its gets completely batshit is when there are claims that with Zero Trust, we don't need VPNs or firewalls any more - identity can resolve everything!! Sorry but perimeters aren't going anywhere - sure they're now different from 1998, but there's still a perimeter, with exposed ports.   \nIdentity management helps organisations sure, but there's a limit by which it can help, before it gets disruptive. 802.1X is one such example.  \nThere's been some other Zero Trusty type efforts with e.g. GCP, where identity can be used instead of TCP source/destination port/address. But this has not only shown to be unmanageable at scale, it's also creating a segregation of duty problem at scale - there's a reason why traditionally firewall management and identity management were segregated.",

Check your email trash folder for signs of password resets.  Look for a common variable that ties the breached accounts with either a common device or common email account.\n\nRun [malwarebytes.com](https://malwarebytes.com) on all your devices.  It doesn't catch everything, but it's free and pretty solid.\n\nOn a trusted device, reset all the password to your online accounts.  If you had saved browser passwords, consider those compromised.  While resetting your password, setup MFA on all of the accounts you have.\n\nThis should be a solid start, I'm sure others have some good suggestions.",

In Europe (you haven't mentioned where you're from) money that's stolen by fraud or hacks is covered so chances are you get at least some money back. Obviously work with the bank to secure your account: they usually have something called multi factor authentication (abbreviation is MFA) which adds a layer to your authentication, i.e. to prove it's really you. Be sure to ask the bank which MFA works best in your situation, because depending on what the attackers have access to, certain forms of MFA would be pointless (for example email verification). \n\nI could go in depth on how to regain control but it's hard because we don't have the complete image of what went down, what got hacked, what access you have or have not etc.",

        "body": "Online tracking, powered by website trackers, cookies, and other technologies, has become a part of our daily digital lives. Collecting information on browsing habits, interactions, and preferences, these tracking mechanisms enables very accurate targeted advertising and personalized content. Cross-site tracking goes even further by creating comprehensive user profiles across multiple websites. What intensifies concerns is the tracking's reach across devices, monitoring our online activities on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Privacy risks emerge as personal data could be potentially misused. Extreme example of personal data privacy intrusion by corporations were recently shown in Black Mirror\u2019s S6E1 \u201cJoan is Awful\u201d which gave me the idea to write this thread. I will discuss on how your collected data can be used against you and how can you protect yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How can this information be used against you?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The collected information from online tracking can be used to target regular internet users with malicious intent.\n* Adversaries can exploit the data to launch targeted phishing attacks, using personalized information to deceive users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts or sensitive data.\n* Personalized advertising based on tracking data can lead to manipulation and deceptive marketing practices, influencing users' purchasing decisions or promoting harmful products or services.\n* User profiling and tracking can result in privacy breaches, with sensitive information falling into the wrong hands, potentially leading to identity theft or financial fraud.\n* Tracking data can be sold to data brokers or shared with third parties without user consent, further compromising privacy and exposing individuals to potential harm.\n* Cybercriminals can leverage tracked data to engage in social engineering tactics, crafting convincing scams or impersonations tailored to the individual's preferences and interests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How can you protect yourself?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* To protect yourself from online tracking and potential harm, consider using a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and hide your IP address, making it difficult for trackers to identify and monitor your online activities. If you don\u2019t have a VPN, I suggest checking\u00a0r/vpn\u00a0[comparison table](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/m736zt/vpn_comparison_table/), it offers lots of info about many good VPN providers, also you can save up some cash with discount codes offered there.\n* Don\u2019t allow various apps to use your phone\u2019s microphone in the background, I would also recommend to get rid of voice-controlled speakers such as Alexa or Google Home.\n* Use privacy-driven browsers such as Brave, DuckDuckGo or similar. Avoid Google Chrome.\n* Utilize tools that are designed to stop trackers, blocks ads such as PrivacyBadger or Adblockplus. My personal favorite is Threat protection - it prevents you from accidentally visiting malicious websites and scans downloaded files for Malware, deleting dangerous ones before they can do any damage.\u00a0It also blocks third-party trackers and offers ad-blocker.\n* Regularly review and adjust the privacy settings in your web browsers and online accounts, ensuring that you have control over what information is being collected and shared.\n* Stay informed about the latest privacy practices and technologies, and educate yourself on how to recognize and avoid potential online threats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this was an interesting read, stay safe!",

Or how do they get this data? Do they get it from Apple directly?  \n\n\nI specifically configured the Instagram app to not allow App Tracking. Or does that just mean that Instagram is not tracking my behaviour in the App, but is however accessing tracked stuff from other servers? (For example that I downloaded LoL) ",

There are many avenues for Meta to build a profile about you or to correlate actions taken on your iPhone with actions taken on your MacBook.\n\nFor example, you've disabled Tracking on your iPhone. As you suggested, this prevents apps from tracking you using a unique advertising identifier. However, when you use Instagram, you're still using a web service. Your IP address, device information, and other details are made available to Meta with every interaction you make with Instagram, and those details are associated with your user account.\n\nConversely, when you use your MacBook and visit web sites that have any trackers owned by Meta, Meta will now know that your IP address visited that web site. Once again, that will be associated with your user account, along with your browser information and any other details available in that web session. Even something as simple as a social media share button is enough for Meta to get those bits of information.\n\nExpand this logic to every single app your run on your iPhone, every web site you visit, everyone else in your school, residence, or business who may share the same IP address, and every other tracker that might sell data to Meta and you can see how easy it is to gather little data points and build out a profile.\n\nIf you aren't already, consider running an ad blocker in both your MacBook and iPhone web browsers, that can help you block some trackers. Ultimately, all you can do is limit your exposure and try to make it harder for them to connect the dots.",

This breach has impacted global organizations, including Zellis, a payroll provider serving major clients such as British Airways, the BBC, Boots, and Aer Lingus. There are concerns that Ofcom and Ernst & Young may have also been affected by this data breach.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/16/moveit-transfer-hack-department-of-energy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/16/moveit-transfer-hack-department-of-energy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** **BlackCat claims they hacked Reddit and will leak the data**\n\nOperators broke into Reddit on February 5, 2023, and took 80 gigabytes (zipped) of data. Reddit was emailed twice by operators, once on April 13 and one again on June 16. Hackers threatened to leak the confidential data that Reddit has collected of its users if money is not paid. Reddit has not responded.\n\n[https://www.databreaches.net/blackcat-claims-they-hacked-reddit-and-will-leak-the-data/](https://www.databreaches.net/blackcat-claims-they-hacked-reddit-and-will-leak-the-data/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Intellihartx Data Breach**\n\nHealthcare management firm Intellihartx confirmed that hackers stole the medical details >500,000 patients, including social security numbers. According to a notice filed with Maine attorney general\u2019s office, the breach took place in January, but wasn't discovered until April.\n\n[Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/intellihartx-data-breach-fortra-ransomware/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADPT3SURDcXfLpJoJaqcB7uW4V0FKYFpCfUHatvMHSO-y5rlDZJHOg28Dl2ZZzU36J943oXMGs0Pj13c_pR3TbCGsZpKxq_2zb099XsOdHrml1dADpxVPPDRO-RZcY9YRdxGYoi5VixUXKB3s6D_WBio56gtrE33Wo_r8Ql1yemh)",

                "body": "info:\nRMF uses a variety of NIST publications, however, the only one that needs to be followed is 800-53. This is important as 800-53 has the entire RMF framework in the document. So while 800-53 are the controls, FIPS-199 is categorization guidance based on data, and FIPS-200 is the selection of the impact level. \n\n- RMF can be implemented per government agency as they deem fit (it's a guidelines/framework that can be modified), but the controls have to be from 800-53. It's the only one that is required, but then subsequently needs the rest since it's in the publication. You can see this in rev-4 clearly, in rev-5 you can see they mentioned they pulled information in the exec summary.\n\n- 800-53 is a control baseline for government agencies as a whole. 800-171 is for CUI, DOD has a classified 8000 series, like DOD 8510 for their implementation of RMF and their sensitivity levels.\n\n- Typically, yes, CUI only needs to be handled with 171 (a subset/smaller set of controls of 800-53), but could require 800-53 controls if the AO/agency requires it.\n\n- federal information system is any federal information system, it could include NSS or any classification of system. It's any system used by the federal government. The classification/type of data is what designated the impact level or the NSS level as well. So think of NSS systems as a subclass of a federal information system.\n\nExample for the last one:\nThe national park service website is a federal information system, typically public information, not a national security system.\n\nThe DOD has a VPN network that allows connections to sensitive (secret/top secret) data. All of these systems are federal information systems. Some may be NSS systems, some may not be. They have to be in the NSS categorization to be considered one.",

You will likely be limiting your earning potential, but you can still make very good money, depending on your location.  You can eventually earn well into six figures over time if you\u2019re always learning and taking opportunities that expand your skills.  You\u2019ll need certification to get a foot in the door somewhere.\n\nThat said, you\u2019re young and can\u2019t yet have an appreciation of time.  If you\u2019re going to approach this from a boot camp certification angle, your road to solid earnings is likely to be long.  And understand that now is the best time to get a degree - as you get more established in your adult life, the harder it is to go back to school.  You\u2019ll have car payments and rent and a job and not much money; it\u2019s a hard transition.\n\nTherefore, this was a sneaky way to agree with the first post.  At the very least try for an associates degree.  A bachelors degree can take you all the way, as masters and MBAs are becoming less attractive over time.  It\u2019s not like \u201cyou must have a masters degree to get this executive job.\u201d  In my experience having worked with many in front line management to executives, I\u2019ve yet to find a person without a bachelors to have the potential to rise to the top.

A lack of logging or not implementing MFA is not necessarily something that would be considered \u201cexploitable\u201d in this context.\n\nThink of a fence. You don\u2019t exploit the structure of a fence if the gate is open. You just walk through. That\u2019s a gap. A vulnerability is having the gate closed and locked with a lock that can easily be picked.\n\nThat\u2019s a very simple metaphor, but hopefully it helps you visualize the differences.",

The risk then is not being managed as instructed by the policy. What if the 2nd line is not providing sufficient oversight of the risks, like by not providing guidance, monitoring, reporting on the risk and control activities?\n\nWho checks on that?

They are supposed to be totally independent and verify that controls are in place, designed and operating effectively per policy and whatnot. Basically that everything we say we\u2019re doing is actually being done and actually addresses the risk at hand. As\ninternal audit reports directly to the board/oversight committee (and there are other rules to promote independence of audit), they provide assurance that the picture is accurate.

At its best, IA can provide recommendations to strengthen controls, catch and address risks before external auditors do, and get exec buy-in for risk management budgets.",

My password is pretty new, 21 characters long, with capital letters, numbers and signs, and I only use said password on very few accounts. I just got this 2fa popup for someone in the US to login to my account, but I live in Denmark, yet the password was correct. When I looked at my recent activities, I had 11 unsuccessfull login attempts. In a single day, just about a week ago, though despite also being from the US, those were denied due to the password being incorrect. So should I assume these were all made by the same person, but they somehow figured out my password? Some of the other login attempts are from other places like Africa and my home country, but the vast majority of them are from the US. I have been using autofill, stayed logged on and haven't manually typed in that password on my pc since long before all the failed login attempts someone tried to make with the wrong passwords, so I don't think I have a keylogger or anything. I do remember clicking a random link from a dm, and then it started downloading a video, which I found it very suspicious, since it didn't look like a link to a video download, so I instantly deleted the video off my phone(can't remember if it was from a dm or a post that I clicked the link.) I also have Bitdefender premium on my pc, so I think my phone could be the only target. Is there a chance that \"video\" file could have stolen saved passwords from my phone, without even being installed/downloaded for 10 seconds, and never opened? Should I just change my password into something even longer and new and hope for the best? \n\nAny and all tips are super appreciated! Thanks for listening.\n\nEdit: Also nvm, the 11 consecutive failed login attempts in the same day are actually made from 11 different cities in 11 different countries. But they were all made within 3 hours, so I assume it was someone with a VPN. Just looked at the first failed login attempt, and assumed they were all from the same country, since they were so close to eachother, with 7 of them being made almost. Every 5-10 minutes.",

Best to be safe and wipe/reset your phone to factory defaults, hoping that a possible exploit (if that is truly the case) didn't nest itself into the bootloader. The capability to perform such exploits usually demands a rather large investment, and, unless you're a government official, someone with power or have direct relations with such a person, the average joe wouldn't usually be the target.\n\nA more likely scenario is that you've been phished, or one of the organisations you have accounts with the same password is compromised. Or perhaps you lend your phone to someone that managed to take a glance at your saved passwords.\n\nAnother possibility is that you signed at say, school or work, where you have your own unique student or work account. If you log into google at school or work, and choose to stay signed, the session data can be saved into your school/work user profile or home directory. IT would have acces to that storage, or they could log into your account, sometimes without having to reset your password, and have full acces to the sites you logged in to previously.\n\nAnyhow, reset and use unique passwords for each service/website, wipe your phone, and never store your passwords in plain text.",

        "body": "How to Create a Face Recognition System Using Deep Learning in Python\n\nCreating a face recognition system using deep learning in Python can be a daunting task for any developer. However, with the right tools and knowledge, it can be surprisingly straightforward. In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of face recognition, deep learning, and Python, and how they all come together to create a powerful system that can detect and identify faces. We will also provide an overview of some of the best open source libraries and frameworks available that can help you in developing your own face recognition system. So, if you\u2019re looking to dive into the world of face recognition deep learning with Python, then this post is for you!\n\n## Prerequisites:\n\nBefore you can create a face recognition system using deep learning in Python, there are some prerequisites you need to be aware of. First, you should have some knowledge of the Python programming language. If you\u2019re new to programming, you might want to familiarize yourself with Python basics before diving into this project.  \nSecond, you\u2019ll need to understand the basics of deep learning. You should know what artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks are, and have some familiarity with concepts such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. If you don\u2019t have this knowledge, there are plenty of tutorials online that can help you learn the fundamentals.\n\n[Read More](https://csehouse.com/how-to-create-a-face-recognition-system-using-deep-learning-in-python/)",

        "body": "Making money is important to me, but I don't need 200K/year. I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.\n\nPlease help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.\n\n# Computer Science (CS)\n\nPros:\n\n* More likely to make a lot amount of money.\n* Probably more work from home jobs.\n* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.\n* Problem solving can be cool\n* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??\n\nCons:\n\n* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.\n* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.\n* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:\n\n1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.\n2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.\n3. Global outsourcing.\n4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.\n\n# Management Information Systems (MIS)\n\nPros:\n\n* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.\n* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.\n* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.\n* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.\n\nCons:\n\n* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS\n* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??\n* People call it the CS drop out degree\n* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??\n* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.\n\nWhich path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???",

Acme Inc. had always been very successful, but as the company grew, so did the number of employees and the complexity of its systems.\n\nOne day, the CIO of Acme Inc. realized that the company's current system of access control was no longer sufficient to protect its resources. Employees were sharing top-secret data which poses great risks if it lies in the wrong hands. They wanted a more secure, dynamic, and flexible system that could adapt to changing circumstances and provide granular control over access to resources.\n\nAfter much research and consultation with his advisors, the CIO decided to implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) in Acme Inc.\n\nUnder the ABAC system, access to resources in Acme Inc. was determined based on attributes or characteristics of users, resources, and the context in which access was requested. For example, a salesperson at Acme Inc. might have access to certain resources based on their job title, their location, and the type of access they were requesting. An engineer might have access to different resources based on their level of experience, the project they were working on, and the type of access they were requesting.\n\nThe ABAC system proved to be a great success in Acme Inc. It allowed the company to adapt to changing circumstances and provided granular control over access to resources, ensuring that only the right people had access to the right resources at the right time.\n\nThanks to the implementation of ABAC, Acme Inc. was able to improve the security and efficiency of its systems, and the company's profits soared as a result. The CIO was hailed as a visionary leader, and the employees of Acme Inc. were able to work more efficiently and effectively than ever before.",

        "body": "There are a lot of tools and approaches for detecting/stopping cyberattacks from a technical perspective, but I'm interested to hear how many businesses are training their staff to challenge and stop \"in person\" breaches, since once someone gains access to a physical site, the damage they could do is kind of limitless.\n\nFull disclosure - I recorded a podcast with two guys from the UK Ministry of Defence (one contracted by Atkins) about how they do it. One method they use is the \"malicious floor walker\", whereby they send someone to infiltrate an office/workshop/wherever and do things like ask people for potentially sensitive information, or to use their laptops, open a door for them etc. all whilst wearing a t-shirt that says \"I'M LYING\" or \"CYBER THREAT\" on them. The idea is to get caught, and praise the person for doing so, in order to give positive reinforcement that it's the right response to seeing something suspicious.\n\nHave you seen anything similar or is it the standard \"watch a training video about looking out for dodgy people and do a quiz at the end\"?\n\n[Here's the podcast for those interested.](https://anchor.fm/netacea/episodes/The-Behavioral-Science-of-Cybersecurity-e1rfvjd)",

                "body": "Awesome! Glad you\u2019re starting the journey in this direction! There are a lot of different directions to go in this field.\n\nIf you\u2019re brand-new to infosec, you\u2019ll want to start with a general know-how of networks and computers. The essentials would be along the lines of the Network+ and the Security+. Those will give you guidelines as to what portions of the a network/software will need to be most secure. The Net+ I recommend to give you context for a lot of the Sec+.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking specifically at application security and secure development, skip the Net+ and look at web application security and secure development practices. A great starting point will be the OWASP top 10:\n\nhttps://owasp.org/Top10/\n\nThese are the top 10 most commonly seen web application vulnerabilities. It will give you guidance on where they are seen and how to correct them.\n\nSec+ may still be in your wheelhouse for secure development, but a smaller slice of it will be. That\u2019s because the focus of the Sec+ is on security generally and not necessarily on software security (though that is a large portion). Depending on what you like to develop, it may be handy to read through it, especially for the encryption pieces.\n\nSecure coding standards may also be of interest to you. They\u2019re a little general, but useful. Especially as an intro to things like Common Weaknesses Enumerations (CWE) and  Common Vulnerability Enumerations (CVE). Here are some guides on that:\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/uscert/bsi/articles/knowledge/coding-practices/mitre-cwe-and-cert-secure-coding-standards\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/\n\nAs for the programming languages to focus on, there isn\u2019t really one. Most commonly, employers for security positions (such as Security Analyst) will look for powershell and/or python experience. In my experience, those are not used a ton in the role, but it\u2019s good to be able to read them and python is gaining more traction by the day.\n\nOtherwise, it sounds like you want to focus on building secure applications. Java, JavaScript (JS), and C/C+ are good ones if you want to having coding ability as your primary concern. Here are some free resources for Java/Python primarily about secure coding:\n\nhttps://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/learning/secure-coding-in-python (LinkedIn learning may be available through your local public library, lots of good stuff)\n\nhttps://ninja-ide.org/best-python-secure-coding-practices-cheat-sheet/\n\nA quick google search will find you some more.\n\nFreecodecamp.org may also be a good place for you not only to develop your coding skills, but IIRC you can also get some security guidelines.\n\nIf you have some money to help you with this, a subscription to O\u2019Reilly publishing is not bad either. They have a lot of great and comprehensive guides. Even just checking out one or two of their books can go a long way. \n\nAgain, check your library to make sure they do not have a subscription or that they don\u2019t have any books on this topic. Or you can ask for them to get either of those.\n\nI also find listening to podcasts tends to help as well. At the very least, it gives you an idea of what it is important, gives you context for discussions you\u2019re hearing, and if you\u2019re like \u201cHmmm\u2026okay\u2026I know some of these words,\u201d you can always look them up. Personally, I like the SANS Internet Storm Center (with Johannes Ullrich where he generally records from Jacksonville, Florida) and the Cyberwire Daily. They will talk about things that are related to the field and frequently have places where you can learn, SANS from more of a tech perspective and Cyberwire from more of a news perspective.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of right now, but feel free to ask any questions you may have. I\u2019m sure other folks will chime in with their recommendations as well. \n\nAs a side note and motivational portion, you will never know everything about this. It\u2019s something I have to remind myself often, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. Get ready to learn for a lifetime. You will learn more and more and new technologies will come out and new languages will come out and new vulnerabilities will be out there. Learning in this field is like trying to catch an eel with your bare hands: just when you think you\u2019ve got it, it slips out again. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed if you don\u2019t know something. Just ask.\n\nGood luck learning! You\u2019re gonna do great!",

It could be a network issue, so you'll need to check the client app logs, switch logs, and firewall logs. It could be a permissions issue, so you'll need to check the windows logs for the file server. You also might need to check the domain controller's logs to see if the user has the correct AD permissions to be accessing the file share. \n\nWith an SIEM, this goes from taking an hour or two of scrolling through multiple system's logs (there's a lot, you might just scroll past it, too) to a couple of minutes and a search string within the SIEM's frontend.\n\nSource: Am a systems admin, just finished my company's Wazuh deployment last week, have been making heavy use of it since.

Cyber security experts can be more technical and tend to have more skills in malware forensics, programming etc.\nInfosec experts tend to be more holistic and look at all aspects of security of information such as clear desk policies, contract management, locked drawers and doors, physical access. They tend to be less interested and technically able in the code of a malware (as an example) compared to cyber security experts - they'll want to know what something does and why, but not the full, excruciating detail. \n\nI guess the other type of security expert is physical or personnel  security... Your security guards or office managers or HR may be more concerned with the security around the \"analogue\" information assets\" such as buildings, paperwork and people, but that's rarely thought of in that way.",

        "body": "Currently I\u2019m in IT Infrastructure - title is going to change, but right now \u201cSenior Analyst, Infrastructure Services\u201d. I\u2019m basically guaranteed a promotion first of next year if I don\u2019t slack off 4th qtr to the next level which is currently \u201cSpecialist\u201d, but will be retitled to \u201cLead Engineer, Infrastructure Services\u201d by that time. I\u2019ve been getting burnt out as we do a lot and don\u2019t have any type of desktop support team. We also do not have a legit Service Desk, so are oncall on a primary / secondary rotation. I\u2019d be ok with that, but basically if we get called for a problem that is clearly applications or networking, we are basically having to contact them. If it were being called for our services being down, ect that\u2019d be totally fine, but that isn\u2019t the case. \n\nAnyhow there is a Jr Security Engineer, Endpoint Security position opening up. I can\u2019t decide if I take a few steps down to a more focused role that can gain me experience in Security and open up new opportunities or stick with the Infrastructure path and continue growing there. I could obviously bust ass and move up through the ranks in security or have that to obtain some certs and move to another company. Sticking to the path I\u2019m on has me closer to mgmt and my own team. \n\nHonestly no idea what I\u2019d like more. Money and stability is obviously huge, so that is the path I want to go down. Security also doesn\u2019t have that oncall issue and would probably rarely even travel. \n\nThoughts, suggestions, what would you guys do? Take a few steps back to get into the Security realm? I\u2019m 38 and I\u2019ve been at this company 9yrs in October. Went from jr, to mid level to sr. \n\nI\u2019m back and forth on it, just can\u2019t figure out what the smartest move is. We are moving to Azure so that\u2019ll be cool to learn, but I\u2019d touch that on the security side as well.",
